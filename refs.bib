  Abstract                 = {In 2001, dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1) populations in humans and mosquitoes from Myanmar acquired a stop-codon mutation in the surface envelope (E) protein gene. Within a year, this stop-codon strain had spread to all individuals sampled. The presence of truncated E protein species within individual viral populations, along with a general relaxation in selective constraint, indicated that the stop-codon strain represents a defective lineage of DENV-1. We propose that such long-term transmission of defective RNA viruses in nature was achieved through complementation by coinfection of host cells with functional viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {The untranslated leader of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome encodes essential sequence and structural motifs that control various replication steps. The 5' splice site or splice donor (SD) is embedded in a semistable hairpin, but the function of this structure is unknown. We stabilized this SD hairpin by creating an additional base pair and demonstrated a severe HIV-1 replication defect. A splicing defect was apparent in RNA analyses of virus-infected cells and cells transfected with appropriate reporter constructs. We selected multiple virus revertants in search for interesting second-site escape pathways. Most revertants acquired an additional mutation that modulated the stability of the mutant SD hairpin. One revertant acquired a single nucleotide change in the upstream DIS hairpin. We demonstrate that a novel SD site is created by this upstream mutation, which obviously reduces the number of leader nucleotides that are included in spliced HIV-1 transcripts. These results suggest a novel role of RNA structure in the regulation of HIV-1 splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {Nucleotide sequences were obtained for portions of the envelope and gag genes of 4 HIV-1 isolates from Nigeria. The gag gene sequences clustered with previously described gag sequences from Gabon, Zaire, and Taiwan, which form the G clade of HIV-1. This documented for the first time the presence of subgroup G viruses in Nigeria. The env gene sequences were most closely related to env sequences reported from 2 isolates previously classified as gag subgroup G and, with those 2 env sequences, defined the subgroup G env genotype. Virus isolates were obtained by cocultivation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Nigerian AIDS patients (isolates JV1018 and JP88) or healthy prostitutes (G3 and G9) with normal uninfected PBMCs (JV1083, JP88, and G3) or GEM-SS, a T cell line (G9). Clones containing env and gag gene sequences were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification, using DNA from these cultures. The region of gag amplified by primers SK37 and SK39 containing BamHI and KpnI sites, respectively, in 5' tails, was cloned into the KpnI-BamHI site of pKSBluescript and sequenced. When the gag sequences from 2 of the Nigerian viruses were subtyped by weighted parsimony, both viruses grouped with others of the gag G subgroup. A similar analysis of env sequences from all 4 Nigerian isolates showed that they were most closely related to 2 env sequences that had been assigned to env subgroup G. The Nigerian env sequences clustered more closely with each other than they did with the other 2 subgroup G viruses. Consensus of the inferred amino acid sequences of the 4 env genes showed that the V3 loop closely resembled the A to F consensus. 8 positions in the Nigerian consensus sequence appeared to be unique. However, whether these are signature residues for Nigerian subgroup G isolates or for subgroup G isolates will require the characterization of more isolates.},

  Abstract                 = {There is considerable HIV-1 variation in patients. The extent of the variation is due to the high rate of viral replication, the high viral load, and the errors made during viral replication. Mutations can arise from errors made either by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II or by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), but the relative contributions of these two enzymes to the mutation rate are unknown. In addition, mutations in RT can affect its fidelity, but the effect of mutations in RT on the nature of the mutations that arise in vivo is poorly understood. We have developed an efficient system, based on existing technology, to analyze the mutations that arise in an HIV-1 vector in a single cycle of replication. A lacZalpha reporter gene is used to identify viral DNAs that contain mutations which are analyzed by DNA sequencing. The forward mutation rate in this system is 1.4 x 10(-5) mutations/bp/cycle, equivalent to the retroviral average. This rate is about 3-fold lower than previously reported for HIV-1 in vivo and is much lower than what has been reported for purified HIV-1 RT in vitro. Although the mutation rate was not affected by the orientation of lacZalpha, the sites favored for mutations (hot spots) in lacZalpha depended on which strand of lacZalpha was present in the viral RNA. The pattern of hot spots seen in lacZalpha in vivo did not match any of the published data obtained when purified RT was used to copy lacZalpha in vitro.},

The relative efficacy and safety of these second-line therapies are not well defined.In this multicenter, open-label trial we randomly assigned 467 patients who previously received zidovudine and had 300 or fewer CD4 cells per cubic millimeter or a diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to treatment with either didanosine (500 mg per day) or zalcitabine (2.25 mg per day).After a median follow-up of 16 months, disease progression or death occurred in 157 of 230 patients assigned to didanosine and 152 of 237 patients assigned to zalcitabine, for a relative risk of 0.93 for the zalcitabine group as compared with the didanosine group (P = 0.56), which decreased to 0.84 (P = 0.15) after adjustment for the CD4 count, Karnofsky score, and presence of AIDS at base line. There were 100 deaths in the didanosine group and 88 in the zalcitabine group, for a relative risk of 0.78 (P = 0.09) and an adjusted relative risk of 0.63 (P = 0.003). A majority of patients in each group (66 percent) had at least one adverse event during treatment (153 patients taking didanosine and 157 taking zalcitabine). Peripheral neuropathy and stomatitis occurred more often with zalcitabine and diarrhea and abdominal pain more frequently with didanosine.For patients with HIV infection who have not responded to treatment with zidovudine, zalcitabine is at least as efficacious as didanosine in delaying disease progression and death.},

  Abstract                 = {The fidelity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) has been a subject of intensive investigation. The mutation frequencies for the purified enzyme in vitro vary widely but are typically in the 10(-4) range (per nucleotide addition), making the enzyme severalfold less accurate than most polymerases, including other RTs. This has often been cited as a factor in HIV's accelerated generation of genetic diversity. However, cellular experiments suggest that HIV does not have significantly lower fidelity than other retroviruses and shows a mutation frequency in the 10(-5) range. In this report, we reconcile, at least in part, these discrepancies by showing that HIV RT fidelity in vitro is in the same range as cellular results from experiments conducted with physiological (for lymphocytes) concentrations of free Mg(2+) (~0.25 mM) and is comparable to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) RT fidelity. The physiological conditions produced mutation rates that were 5 to 10 times lower than those obtained under typically employed in vitro conditions optimized for RT activity (5 to 10 mM Mg(2+)). These results were consistent in both commonly used lacZα complementation and steady-state fidelity assays. Interestingly, although HIV RT showed severalfold-lower fidelity under high-Mg(2+) (6 mM) conditions, MuLV RT fidelity was insensitive to Mg(2+). Overall, the results indicate that the fidelity of HIV replication in cells is compatible with findings of experiments carried out in vitro with purified HIV RT, providing more physiological conditions are used.Human immunodeficiency virus rapidly evolves through the generation and subsequent selection of mutants that can circumvent the immune response and escape drug therapy. This process is fueled, in part, by the presumably highly error-prone HIV polymerase reverse transcriptase (RT). Paradoxically, results of studies examining HIV replication in cells indicate an error frequency that is ~10 times lower than the rate for RT in the test tube, which invokes the possibility of factors that make RT more accurate in cells. This study brings the cellular and test tube results in closer agreement by showing that HIV RT is not more error prone than other RTs and, when assayed under physiological magnesium conditions, has a much lower error rate than in typical assays conducted using conditions optimized for enzyme activity.},

  Abstract                 = {The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes, including humans. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the Drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome encodes approximately 13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegans genome, but with comparable functional diversity.},

ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This fast approach to cDNA characterization will facilitate the tagging of most human genes in a few years at a fraction of the cost of complete genomic sequencing, provide new genetic markers, and serve as a resource in diverse biological research fields.},

In vitro, mutations at all but 2 positions of the consensus 5' splice region impair correct splicing and promote joining of exon 1 to exon 3. In vivo, the same mutations show no effect, except for those converting 5' GT to AT or GA, which cause accumulation of lariat intermediate in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the 5' GT need not be conserved for 5' cleavage and that it plays an important role in cleavage and exon joining at the 3' splice site.},

The Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods (FlowCAP) challenges were established to compare the performance of these methods on two tasks: (i) mammalian cell population identification, to determine whether automated algorithms can reproduce expert manual gating and (ii) sample classification, to determine whether analysis pipelines can identify characteristics that correlate with external variables (such as clinical outcome). This analysis presents the results of the first FlowCAP challenges. Several methods performed well as compared to manual gating or external variables using statistical performance measures, which suggests that automated methods have reached a sufficient level of maturity and accuracy for reliable use in FCM data analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {CD4 is crucial for antigen-driven helper T cell signaling and is used as receptor by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The HIV early protein Nef causes a loss of CD4 from cell surfaces through a previously undefined posttranscriptional mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that Nef acts by inducing CD4 endocytosis, resulting in its degradation in lysosomes. CD4 down-regulation is strongly enhanced by the association of Nef with cell membranes through myristoylation. The study of chimeric molecules reveals that 20 membrane-proximal residues of the CD4 cytoplasmic domain are sufficient to confer Nef sensitivity. Within this region, a dileucine motif, reminiscent of an endocytosis and lysosomal targeting signal found in the CD3 gamma and delta chains, is crucial for CD4 response to Nef.},

In this report, we show that the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) factor UPF1 is also a component of the HIV-1 RNP. We investigated the role of UPF1 in HIV-1-expressing cells. Depletion of UPF1 by siRNA resulted in a dramatic reduction in steady-state HIV-1 RNA and pr55(Gag). Pr55(Gag) synthesis, but not the cognate genomic RNA, was efficiently rescued by expression of an siRNA-insensitive UPF1, demonstrating that UPF1 positively influences HIV-1 RNA translatability. Conversely, overexpression of UPF1 led to a dramatic up-regulation of HIV-1 expression at the RNA and protein synthesis levels. The effects of UPF1 on HIV-1 RNA stability were observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm and required ongoing translation. We also demonstrate that the effects exerted by UPF1 on HIV-1 expression were dependent on its ATPase activity, but were separable from its role in NMD and did not require interaction with UPF2.},

Here, we show that overexpression of RNase L decreases cellular growth and downmodulates the RNA-binding protein, HuR, a regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. The effect is temporal, occurring in specific cell-cycle phases and correlated with the cytoplasmic localization of RNase L. Both cellular growth and HuR were increased in RNASEL-null mouse fibroblast lines when compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, the stability of HuR mRNA was enhanced in RNASEL-null cells. The HuR 3' untranslated region (UTR), which harbors U-rich and adenylate-uridylate-rich elements, was potently responsive to RNase L when compared to control 3' UTR. Our results may offer a new explanation to the tumor suppressor function of RNase L.},

This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite their importance in gene innovation and phenotypic variation, duplicated regions have remained largely intractable owing to difficulties in accurately resolving their structure, copy number and sequence content. We present an algorithm (mrFAST) to comprehensively map next-generation sequence reads, which allows for the prediction of absolute copy-number variation of duplicated segments and genes. We examine three human genomes and experimentally validate genome-wide copy number differences. We estimate that, on average, 73–87 genes vary in copy number between any two individuals and find that these genic differences overwhelmingly correspond to segmental duplications (odds ratio = 135; P < 2.2 times 10-16). Our method can distinguish between different copies of highly identical genes, providing a more accurate assessment of gene content and insight into functional constraint without the limitations of array-based technology.},

  Abstract                 = {When targeting promoter regions, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) trigger a previously proposed pathway known as transcriptional gene silencing by promoting heterochromatin formation. Here we show that siRNAs targeting intronic or exonic sequences close to an alternative exon regulate the splicing of that exon. The effect occurred in hepatoma and HeLa cells with siRNA antisense strands designed to enter the silencing pathway, suggesting hybridization with nascent pre-mRNA. Unexpectedly, in HeLa cells the sense strands were also effective, suggesting that an endogenous antisense transcript, detectable in HeLa but not in hepatoma cells, acts as a target. The effect depends on Argonaute-1 and is counterbalanced by factors favoring chromatin opening or transcriptional elongation. The increase in heterochromatin marks (dimethylation at Lys9 and trimethylation at Lys27 of histone H3) at the target site, the need for the heterochromatin-associated protein HP1alpha and the reduction in RNA polymerase II processivity suggest a mechanism involving the kinetic coupling of transcription and alternative splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {Cutaneous gene therapy can be envisioned through the use of keratinocyte stem cell clones in which retroviral genotoxic risks can be pre-assessed. While transactivation of cellular genes by the retroviral long terminal repeat enhancer has been proven in experimental and clinical settings, the formation of chimeric viral-cellular transcripts originated by the inefficient termination (read-through) of retroviral transcripts remains to be studied in depth. We now demonstrate the widespread presence of viral-cellular fusion transcripts derived from integrated proviruses in keratinocytes transduced with self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors. We have detected high molecular weight RNAs in northern blot analysis of retroviral vector expression in individual cell clones. Characterization of some of these transcripts revealed that they originate from genes located at the proviral integration sites. One class of transcripts corresponds to fusions of the viral vectors with intronic sequences, terminating at cryptic polyadenylation sites located in introns. A second class comprises fusion transcripts with coding sequences of genes at the integration sites. These are generated through splicing from a cryptic, not previously described donor site in the lentiviral vectors to exons of cellular genes, and have the potential to encode unintended open reading frames, although they are downregulated by cellular mechanisms. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the impact of SIN lentiviral vector integration on cellular gene transcription, and will be helpful in improving the design of this type of vectors.},

  Abstract                 = {The mRNA isolated from B lymphocyte tumor cell lines directs synthesis of two forms of μ heavy chain, one with a molecular weight of 67K and one of 64K. When these cell lines are converted to IgM-secreting cells by fusion with a myeloma cell, the 64K form of μ predominates; thus it is designated μs (μ-secreted). The 67K form correlates with the presence of surface IgM; thus it is designated μm (μ-membrane). Cells that make both forms of μ chain have two mRNAs, one of 2.4 kb that encodes μs and one of 2.7 kb that encodes μm. The difference between the μs and μm mRNAs can be localized to their 3′ ends by hybridizing 32P-cDNA copies of the mRNA to a cloned copy of μs mRNA, treating the mixtures with SI nuclease, and resolving the nuclease-resistant duplexes by electrophoresis. By probing the separated species of RNA with a DNA copy of the 3′ untranslated region of μs mRNA, it was shown that the 3′ ends of the two μ mRNAs do not cross-hybridize. The difference between the two RNAs was mapped to the 3′ edge of the Cμ4 domain. Apparently two separate 3′ terminal sequences for μ mRNA are encoded in the genome, one that specifies an amino acid sequence appropriate for membrane-binding and a second that is involved in secretion. At different stages of immunocyte development, different μ mRNAs predominate: μm during the lymphocyte stages and μs during the secretion stages.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of retroviral vectors in the human genome follows non random patterns that favor insertional deregulation of gene expression and may cause risks of insertional mutagenesis when used in clinical gene therapy. Understanding how viral vectors integrate into the human genome is a key issue in predicting these risks. We provide a new statistical method to compare retroviral integration patterns. We identified the positions where vectors derived from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) show different integration behaviors in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Non-parametric density estimation was used to identify candidate comparative hotspots, which were then tested and ranked. We found 100 significative comparative hotspots, distributed throughout the chromosomes. HIV hotspots were wider and contained more genes than MLV ones. A Gene Ontology analysis of HIV targets showed enrichment of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, reflecting the high HIV integration frequency observed at the MHC locus on chromosome 6. Four histone modifications/variants had a different mean density in comparative hotspots (H2AZ, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me1), while gene expression within the comparative hotspots did not differ from background. These findings suggest the existence of epigenetic or nuclear three-dimensional topology contexts guiding retroviral integration to specific chromosome areas.},

We have used an in vitro splicing assay to identify cis elements within the viral genome that regulate HIV-1 RNA splicing. A novel splicing regulatory element (SRE) within the first tat coding exon has been detected. This element specifically inhibits splicing at the upstream 3' splice site flanking this tat exon. The element only functions when in the sense orientation and is position dependent when inserted downstream of a heterologous 3' splice site. In vivo, an HIV-1 SRE mutant demonstrated a decrease in unspliced viral RNA, increased levels of single- and double-spliced tat mRNA, and reduced levels of env and rev mRNAs. In addition to the negative cis-acting SRE, the flanking 5' splice site downstream of the first tat coding exon acts positively to increase splicing at the upstream 3' splice sites. These results are consistent with hypotheses of bridging interactions between cellular factors that bind to the 5' splice site and those that bind at the upstream 3' splice site.},

  Abstract                 = {Combination antiretroviral therapy has led to significant increases in survival and quality of life, but at a population-level the effect on life expectancy is not well understood. Our objective was to compare changes in mortality and life expectancy among HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy.The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration is a multinational collaboration of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North America. Patients were included in this analysis if they were aged 16 years or over and antiretroviral-naive when initiating combination therapy. We constructed abridged life tables to estimate life expectancies for individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996-99, 2000-02, and 2003-05, and stratified by sex, baseline CD4 cell count, and history of injecting drug use. The average number of years remaining to be lived by those treated with combination antiretroviral therapy at 20 and 35 years of age was estimated. Potential years of life lost from 20 to 64 years of age and crude mortality rates were also calculated.18 587, 13 914, and 10 854 eligible patients initiated combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996-99, 2000-02, and 2003-05, respectively. 2056 (4.7\%) deaths were observed during the study period, with crude mortality rates decreasing from 16.3 deaths per 1000 person-years in 1996-99 to 10.0 deaths per 1000 person-years in 2003-05. Potential years of life lost per 1000 person-years also decreased over the same time, from 366 to 189 years. Life expectancy at age 20 years increased from 36.1 (SE 0.6) years to 49.4 (0.5) years. Women had higher life expectancies than did men. Patients with presumed transmission via injecting drug use had lower life expectancies than did those from other transmission groups (32.6 [1.1] years vs 44.7 [0.3] years in 2003-05). Life expectancy was lower in patients with lower baseline CD4 cell counts than in those with higher baseline counts (32.4 [1.1] years for CD4 cell counts below 100 cells per muL vs 50.4 [0.4] years for counts of 200 cells per muL or more).Life expectancy in HIV-infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy increased between 1996 and 2005, although there is considerable variability between subgroups of patients. The average number of years remaining to be lived at age 20 years was about two-thirds of that in the general population in these countries.},

  Abstract                 = {Mortality in HIV-infected patients has declined substantially with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), but it is unclear whether it has reached that of the general population. We compared mortality in patients starting ART in nine countries of Europe and North America with the corresponding general population, taking into account their response to ART.Eligible patients were enrolled in prospective cohort studies participating in the ART Cohort Collaboration. We calculated the ratio of observed to expected deaths from all causes [standardized mortality ratio (SMR)], measuring time from 6 months after starting ART, according to risk group, clinical stage at the start of ART and CD4 cell count and viral load at 6 months. Expected numbers of deaths were obtained from age-, sex- and country-specific mortality rates.Among 29 935 eligible patients, 1134 deaths were recorded in 131 510 person-years of follow-up. The median age was 37 years, 8162 (27\%) patients were females, 4400 (15\%) were injecting drug users (IDUs) and 6738 (23\%) had AIDS when starting ART. At 6 months, 23 539 patients (79\%) had viral load measurements <or=500 copies/ml. The lowest SMR, 1.05 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-1.35] was found for men who have sex with men (MSM) who started ART free of AIDS, reached a CD4 cell count of >or=350 cells/microL and suppressed viral replication to <or=500 copies/ml by the sixth month. In contrast, the SMR was 73.7 (95\% CI 46.4-116.9) in IDUs who failed to suppress viral replication and had CD4 cell counts <50 cells/microL at 6 months. The percentage of patients with SMRs <2 was 46\% for MSM, 42\% for heterosexually infected patients and 0\% for patients with a history of injection drug use. Corresponding percentages for SMRs >10 were 4, 14 and 47\%.In industrialized countries, the mortality experience of HIV-infected patients who start ART and survive the first 6 months continues to be higher than in the general population, but for many patients excess mortality is moderate and comparable with patients having other chronic conditions. Much of the excess mortality might be prevented by earlier diagnosis of HIV followed by timely initiation of ART.},

  Abstract                 = {Retroviral envelopes are pathogenic glycoproteins which cause neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. The human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) envelope protein, Syncytin-1, is highly expressed in CNS glia of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Syncytin-1 mediated neuroimmune activation and oligodendrocytes damage. In brain tissue from individuals with MS, ASCT1, a receptor for Syncytin-1 and a neutral amino acid transporter, was selectively suppressed in astrocytes (p < 0.05). Syncytin-1 induced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), in cultured astrocytes, similar to findings in MS brains. Overexpression of OASIS in astrocytes increased inducible NO synthase expression but concurrently down-regulated ASCT1 (p < 0.01). Treatment of astrocytes with a NO donor enhanced expression of early growth response 1, with an ensuing reduction in ASCT1 expression (p < 0.05). Small-interfering RNA molecules targeting Syncytin-1 selectively down-regulated its expression, preventing the suppression of ASCT1 and the release of oligodendrocyte cytotoxins by astrocytes. A Syncytin-1-transgenic mouse expressing Syncytin-1 under the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter demonstrated neuroinflammation, ASCT1 suppression, and diminished levels of myelin proteins in the corpus callosum, consistent with observations in CNS tissues from MS patients together with neurobehavioral abnormalities compared with wild-type littermates (p < 0.05). Thus, Syncytin-1 initiated an OASIS-mediated suppression of ASCT1 in astrocytes through the induction of inducible NO synthase with ensuing oligodendrocyte injury. These studies provide new insights into the role of HERV-mediated neuroinflammation and its contribution to an autoimmune disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a daunting problem. Given the limited evidence that resting CD4+ T cell infection (RCI) is affected by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA), we measured the stability of RCI and residual viremia in patients who added VPA with or without raltegravir (RAL), or enfuvirtide (ENF) with or without VPA, to standard ART.Patients with plasma HIV RNA<50 c/mL added sustained-release VPA (Depakote ER) twice daily, RAL 400 mg twice daily, or ENF 90 mcg twice daily. Change in RCI was measured by outgrowth assays. Low-level viremia was quantitated by single-copy plasma HIV RNA assay (SCA).In three patients on standard ART a depletion of RCI was observed after 16 weeks of VPA, but this effect waned over up to 96 weeks of further VPA. In two patients ENF added to stable ART had no effect on RCI. Simultaneous intensification with ENF and addition of VPA had no effect on RCI frequency in one patient, and resulted in a 46\% decline in a second. No significant depletion of RCI (>50\%) was seen in six volunteers after the addition of RAL and VPA. In 4 of the 6 patients this lack of effect might be attributed to intermittent viremia, low VPA levels, or intermittent study therapy adherence. Overall, there was no effect of the addition of RAL or ENF on low-level viremia measured by SCA.The prospective addition of VPA and RAL, VPA and ENF, or ENF failed to progressively reduce the frequency of RCI, or ablate intermittent and low-level viremia. New approaches such as more potent HDAC inhibition, alone or in combination with intensified ART or other agents that may disrupt proviral latency must be pursued.},

In J89, a Jurkat T cell line infected with a single HIV genome encoding the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) within the HIV genome, SAHA induced changes at nucleosome 1 of the HIV promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in concert with EGFP expression.

Inducing the expression of latent genomes within resting CD4(+) T cells is the primary strategy to clear this reservoir. Although histone deacetylase inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (also known as vorinostat, VOR) can disrupt HIV-1 latency in vitro, the utility of this approach has never been directly proven in a translational clinical study of HIV-infected patients. Here we isolated the circulating resting CD4(+) T cells of patients in whom viraemia was fully suppressed by antiretroviral therapy, and directly studied the effect of VOR on this latent reservoir. In each of eight patients, a single dose of VOR increased both biomarkers of cellular acetylation, and simultaneously induced an increase in HIV RNA expression in resting CD4(+) cells (mean increase, 4.8-fold). This demonstrates that a molecular mechanism known to enforce HIV latency can be therapeutically targeted in humans, provides proof-of-concept for histone deacetylase inhibitors as a therapeutic class, and defines a precise approach to test novel strategies to attack and eradicate latent HIV infection directly.},

Sensitivity to inhibition by lamivudine (3TC) and TAK-779 of historical and recent R5 HIV-1 isolates was measured in a subset of samples.Overall, the historical HIV-1 out-competed the recent HIV-1 isolates in 176 of 238 competitions and in 9 of 12 competitions carefully matched for CD4 cell count. The mean relative replicative fitness (W) of all historical HIV-1 strains was significantly greater than that of recent HIV-1 isolates (W(1986-1989) = 1.395 and W(2002-2003) = 0.545, P < 0.001 (t test)). The more fit viruses (mean W > 1) from 1986-1989 appeared less sensitive to TAK-779 and 3TC than did the less fit (mean W < 1) 2002-2003 viruses.These findings suggest that HIV-1 replicative fitness may have decreased in the human population since the start of the pandemic. This 'attenuation' could be the consequence of serial bottlenecks during transmission and result in adaptation of HIV-1 to the human host.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluctuations in rates of gene expression can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch point in a pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage lambda lysis-lysogeny decision circuit as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations. The kinetic model of the decision circuit uses the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, stochastic mechanisms of gene expression, and a statistical-thermodynamic model of promoter regulation. Conventional deterministic kinetics cannot be used to predict statistics of regulatory systems that produce probabilistic outcomes. Rather, a stochastic kinetic analysis must be used to predict statistics of regulatory outcomes for such stochastically regulated systems.},

In quiescent cells activated prior to infection, viral RNA was seen 12 h postinfection; when cells were stimulated postinfection, viral RNA was not seen until 36 h postinfection. Up-regulation of viral RNA in latently infected cells occurred within 2 h poststimulation. This hierarchy also held true for viral protein production.

By functional mapping of complementary DNA transcripts of viral messenger RNA's the major functional domain of the gene encoding this factor was localized to a region immediately before the env gene of the virus, a region previously thought to be noncoding. This newly identified gene consists of three exons, and its transcription into messenger RNA involves two splicing events bringing together sequences from the 5' part (287 base pairs), middle (268 base pairs), and 3'part (1258 base pairs) of the HTLV-III genome. A similar messenger RNA with a truncated second exon (70 base pairs) does not encode a trans-acting function. It is proposed that this second messenger RNA is the transcript of a gene (3'-orf) located after the env gene. Messenger RNA's were also identified for the env and gag-pol genes of HTLV-III.},

Characterizing the mode of action of the GAR ESE inside the internal HIV-1 exon 5 we found that this enhancer fulfils a dual splicing regulatory function (i) by synergistically mediating exon recognition through its individual SR protein-binding sites and (ii) by conferring 3' ss selectivity within the 3' ss cluster preceding exon 5. Both functions depend upon the GAR ESE, U1 snRNP binding at the downstream 5' ss D4 and the E42 sequence located between these elements. Therefore, a network of cross-exon interactions appears to regulate splicing of the alternative exons 4a and 5. As the GAR ESE-mediated activation of the upstream 3' ss cluster also is essential for the processing of intron-containing vpu/env-mRNAs during intermediate viral gene expression, the GAR enhancer substantially contributes to the regulation of viral replication.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for detecting chimeras and other anomalies within 16S rRNA sequence records is presented. Using this method, we screened 1,399 sequences from 19 phyla, as defined by the Ribosomal Database Project, release 9, update 22, and found 5.0% to harbor substantial errors. Of these, 64.3% were obvious chimeras, 14.3% were unidentified sequencing errors, and 21.4% were highly degenerate. In all, 11 phyla contained obvious chimeras, accounting for 0.8 to 11% of the records for these phyla. Many chimeras (43.1%) were formed from parental sequences belonging to different phyla. While most comprised two fragments, 13.7% were composed of at least three fragments, often from three different sources. A separate analysis of the Bacteroidetes phylum (2,739 sequences) also revealed 5.8% records to be anomalous, of which 65.4% were apparently chimeric. Overall, we conclude that, as a conservative estimate, 1 in every 20 public database records is likely to be corrupt. Our results support concerns recently expressed over the quality of the public repositories. With 16S rRNA sequence data increasingly playing a dominant role in bacterial systematics and environmental biodiversity studies, it is vital that steps be taken to improve screening of sequences prior to submission. To this end, we have implemented our method as a program with a simple-to-use graphic user interface that is capable of running on a range of computer platforms.

  Abstract                 = {RNA-based approaches are promising for long-term gene therapy against HIV-1. They can target virtually any step of the viral replication cycle. It is also possible to combine anti-HIV-1 transgenes targeting different facets of HIV replication to compensate for limitations of any individual construct, maximizing efficacy and decreasing chances of escape mutations. We have previously developed two strategies to inhibit HIV-1 multiplication. One was a short hairpin RNA targeting the host factor cyclophilin A implicated in HIV-1 replication. Additionally, an antisense derivative of U7 small nuclear RNA was designed to induce the skipping of the HIV-1 Tat and Rev internal exons.In the present study, we have established an additional tRNAval promoter-driven shRNA against the coding sequence of viral infectivity factor. When human T-cell lines or primary CD4+ T cells are transduced with a triple lentiviral vector encoding these three therapeutic RNAs, HIV-1 multiplication is very efficiently suppressed. Moreover, all three therapeutic RNAs exhibit antiviral effects at early stages of the viral replication cycle (i.e. prior to viral cDNA integration or gene expression).These findings make this triple lentiviral vector an attractive candidate for a gene therapy against HIV/AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev are encoded by multiply spliced mRNAs that differ by the use of alternative 3' splice sites at the beginning of the internal exon. If these internal exons are skipped, the expression of these genes, and hence HIV-1 multiplication, should be inhibited. We have previously developed a strategy, based on antisense derivatives of U7 small nuclear RNA, that allows us to induce the skipping of an internal exon in virtually any gene. Here, we have successfully applied this approach to induce a partial skipping of the Tat, Rev (and Nef) internal exons. Three functional U7 constructs were subcloned into a lentiviral vector. Two of them strongly reduced the efficiency of lentiviral particle production compared to vectors carrying either no U7 insert or unrelated U7 cassettes. This defect could be partly or fully compensated by coexpressing Rev from an unspliced mRNA in the producing cell line. Upon stable transduction into CEM-SS or CEM T-lymphocytes, the most efficient of these constructs inhibits HIV-1 multiplication. Although the inhibition is not complete, it is more efficient in combination with another mechanism inhibiting HIV multiplication. Therefore, this new approach targeting HIV-1 regulatory genes at the level of pre-mRNA splicing, in combination with other antiviral strategies, may be a useful new tool in the fight against HIV/AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA viruses infecting a host usually exist as a set of closely related sequences, referred to as quasispecies. The genomic diversity of viral quasispecies is a subject of great interest, particularly for chronic infections, since it can lead to resistance to existing therapies. High-throughput sequencing is a promising approach to characterizing viral diversity, but unfortunately standard assembly software was originally designed for single genome assembly and cannot be used to simultaneously assemble and estimate the abundance of multiple closely related quasispecies sequences.In this paper, we introduce a new Viral Spectrum Assembler (ViSpA) method for quasispecies spectrum reconstruction and compare it with the state-of-the-art ShoRAH tool on both simulated and real 454 pyrosequencing shotgun reads from HCV and HIV quasispecies. Experimental results show that ViSpA outperforms ShoRAH on simulated error-free reads, correctly assembling 10 out of 10 quasispecies and 29 sequences out of 40 quasispecies. While ShoRAH has a significant advantage over ViSpA on reads simulated with sequencing errors due to its advanced error correction algorithm, ViSpA is better at assembling the simulated reads after they have been corrected by ShoRAH. ViSpA also outperforms ShoRAH on real 454 reads. Indeed, 7 most frequent sequences reconstructed by ViSpA from a real HCV dataset are viable (do not contain internal stop codons), and the most frequent sequence was within 1\% of the actual open reading frame obtained by cloning and Sanger sequencing. In contrast, only one of the sequences reconstructed by ShoRAH is viable. On a real HIV dataset, ShoRAH correctly inferred only 2 quasispecies sequences with at most 4 mismatches whereas ViSpA correctly reconstructed 5 quasispecies with at most 2 mismatches, and 2 out of 5 sequences were inferred without any mismatches. ViSpA source code is available at http://alla.cs.gsu.edu/~software/VISPA/vispa.html.ViSpA enables accurate viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction from 454 pyrosequencing reads. We are currently exploring extensions applicable to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from bacterial metagenomic samples and ecological samples of eukaryote populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyadenylic acid-containing cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from a dimethylhydrazine-induced mouse transplantable colon carcinoma. Double-stranded complementary DNA synthesized using these molecules was inserted into the HindIII site of pBR322 using HindIII linkers, and the recombinant molecules were cloned in Escherichia coli. Clones were screened with labeled complementary DNA synthesized from the polyadenylic acid-containing cytoplasmic RNA of the tumor or normal mouse colon, liver, or kidney. Of 378 clones screened with the normal colon and tumor probes, seven showed major increases in abundance in the tumor tissue as compared to normal, and one showed a major decrease. Twenty-five other sequences were found which showed smaller increases and 22 showed smaller decreases. Of 373 clones screened with tumor, colon, liver, and kidney probes, 79\% exhibited little evidence of tissue specificity in expression. The data for those sequences which do show tissue-specific regulation of expression suggest that the tumor continues to express sequences characteristic of the colon but also shows a loss, or decrease, in other gene products, most of which (19 of 25) are characteristic of the colon. Finally, nine of 10 sequences which increase from low abundance in the normal colon to high abundance in the tumor are found at a moderate to high level in the liver and kidney. On the other hand, 23 of 36 sequences which show more modest increases in the tumor as compared to normal are scarce or absent in the liver and kidney.},

  Abstract                 = {The human endogenous retrovirus K family (HERV-K) comprises 30 to 50 closely related proviruses, most of which are defective. In contrast to all other human endogenous retroviruses, some HERV-K proviruses have maintained open reading frames for all viral proteins. In addition to the structural proteins Gag and Env and the reverse transcriptase, two regulatory proteins (Rec and Np9) have been described. Malignant melanoma has the highest mortality among skin cancers and is particularly aggressive. To study the expression of HERV-K, a set of seven primers was developed that allows discrimination between full-length and spliced mRNA and mRNA from deleted and undeleted proviruses. Expression of full-length mRNA from deleted and undeleted proviruses was detected in all human cells investigated. Expression of spliced env and rec was detected in a teratocarcinoma cell line, in 45\% of the metastatic melanoma biopsies, and in 44\% of the melanoma cell lines. In normal neonatal melanocytes, spliced rec was detected but not spliced env. Viral proteins were shown to be expressed in primary melanomas, metastases, and melanoma cell lines by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses using specific antisera. For the first time, antibodies against HERV-K were found in melanoma patients. Melanomas are, in addition to teratocarcinomas and human breast cancer, the third tumor type with enhanced expression of HERV-K.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of expressed sequence tag data sets have revealed large numbers of splicing variants for human genes, but it remains challenging to distinguish functionally important variants from aberrant splicing, clarify the nature of the alternative functions, and understand the signals that regulate splicing choices. To help address these issues, we have constructed and analyzed a large data set of 1,478 exon-skipping alternative splicing (AS) variants evolutionarily conserved in human and mouse. In about one-fifth of cases, one isoform appears subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), supporting the idea that a major role of AS is to regulate gene expression; one-quarter of these NMD-inducing cases involve a conserved exon whose apparent sole purpose is to mediate destruction of the message when included. We explore sequence conservation likely related to splicing regulation, using in part a measure of the overall amount of conserved information in a sequence, and find that the increased conservation that has been observed within AS exons primarily affects synonymous sites, suggesting that regulatory signals significantly constrain synonymous substitution rates. We show that a lower frequency of the inclusion isoform relative to the exclusion isoform tends to be associated with weaker splice site signals, smaller exon size, and higher intronic sequence conservation, and provide evidence that all of these factors are under selection to control relative isoform frequencies. Some conserved instances of AS appear to represent aberrant splicing events that by chance have occurred in both species, and we develop a nonparametric likelihood approach to identify these.},

  Abstract                 = {The isolation of a pure population of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cells is highly desirable for evaluating the impact of HIV on cellular gene expression. Given that HIV gp41 transmembrane protein is anchored on the surface of HIV-infected cells, we evaluated the use of pooled anti-gp41 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and HIV immunoglobulins (HIV-Igs) indirectly conjugated to magnetic microbeads to positively select for infected cells. We demonstrate that pooled anti-gp41 monoclonal antibodies enriched for H9 cells infected with HIV IIIB by approximately 98\%. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with a primary (HIV strain 302151) or laboratory-adapted (IIIB) strain were enriched by 54\%-62\%, depending on the initial viral inoculum. Using HIV-Ig in this magnetic positive-selection approach was also highly efficient for enriching for H9 cells infected with IIIB but less efficient for infected PBMCs. Both types of antibodies used in the selection process resulted in > 80 viability of selected HIV-infected cells. Analysis of interleukin 2 (IL-2) mRNA expression using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of the HIV-enriched population demonstrated a higher level of IL-2 mRNA, by approximately four cycles, and an 8-fold increase in IL-2 expression, as evaluated by intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis, in comparison to gp41-negative cells. Collectively, these data illustrate that antibodies targeting gp41 can be used to enrich for HIV-positive populations. This represents a novel approach for studying the impact of HIV on infected cells and on bystander/uninfected cells.},

  Abstract                 = {High throughput sequencing-by-synthesis is an emerging technology that allows the rapid production of millions of bases of data. Although the sequence reads are short, they can readily be used for re-sequencing. By re-sequencing the mRNA products of a cell, one may rapidly discover polymorphisms and splice variants particular to that cell.We present the utility of massively parallel sequencing by synthesis for profiling the transcriptome of a human prostate cancer cell-line, LNCaP, that has been treated with the synthetic androgen, R1881. Through the generation of approximately 20 megabases (MB) of EST data, we detect transcription from over 10,000 gene loci, 25 previously undescribed alternative splicing events involving known exons, and over 1,500 high quality single nucleotide discrepancies with the reference human sequence. Further, we map nearly 10,000 ESTs to positions on the genome where no transcription is currently predicted to occur. We also characterize various obstacles with using sequencing by synthesis for transcriptome analysis and propose solutions to these problems.The use of high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis methods for transcript profiling allows the specific and sensitive detection of many of a cell's transcripts, and also allows the discovery of high quality base discrepancies, and alternative splice variants. Thus, this technology may provide an effective means of understanding various disease states, discovering novel targets for disease treatment, and discovery of novel transcripts.},

Therefore, it is an ongoing task to identify new targets for antiretroviral therapy and to develop new drugs. Here, we show that an indole derivative (IDC16) that interferes with exonic splicing enhancer activity of the SR protein splicing factor SF2/ASF suppresses the production of key viral proteins, thereby compromising subsequent synthesis of full-length HIV-1 pre-mRNA and assembly of infectious particles. IDC16 inhibits replication of macrophage- and T cell-tropic laboratory strains, clinical isolates, and strains with high-level resistance to inhibitors of viral protease and reverse transcriptase. Importantly, drug treatment of primary blood cells did not alter splicing profiles of endogenous genes involved in cell cycle transition and apoptosis. Thus, human splicing factors represent novel and promising drug targets for the development of antiretroviral therapies, particularly for the inhibition of multidrug-resistant viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) exerts potent antitumor activity, although the molecular mechanisms underlying its oncolytic properties remain to be fully clarified. Here, we demonstrate that normally resistant murine embryonic fibroblasts are rendered highly permissive to VSV replication following cellular transformation, a progression that appears to compromise the antiviral effects of interferon (IFN). Subsequent studies revealed normal dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activation and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) alpha. Nevertheless, eIF2B-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange activity downstream of eIF2 was frequently aberrant in transformed cells, neutralizing eIF2alpha phosphorylation and permitting VSV mRNA translation. Thus, defects in translational regulation can cooperate with impaired IFN signaling to facilitate VSV replication, and may represent a common hallmark of tumorigenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Retroviruses pack multiple genes into relatively small genomes by encoding several genes in the same genomic region with overlapping reading frames. Both sense and antisense HIV-1 transcripts contain open reading frames for known functional proteins as well as numerous alternative reading frames (ARFs). At least some ARFs have the potential to encode proteins of unknown function, and their antigenic properties can be considered as cryptic epitopes (CEs). To examine the extent of active immune response to virally encoded CEs, we analyzed human leukocyte antigen class I-associated polymorphisms in HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes from a large cohort of South Africans with chronic infection. In all, 391 CEs and 168 conventional epitopes were predicted, with the majority (307; 79\%) of CEs derived from antisense transcripts. In further evaluation of CD8 T cell responses to a subset of the predicted CEs in patients with primary or chronic infection, both sense- and antisense-encoded CEs were immunogenic at both stages of infection. In addition, CEs often mutated during the first year of infection, which was consistent with immune selection for escape variants. These findings indicate that the HIV-1 genome might encode and deploy a large potential repertoire of unconventional epitopes to enhance vaccine-induced antiviral immunity.},

Multivariant transmission was more common in IDUs than in heterosexuals (60\% versus 19\%; odds ratio, 6.14; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 31.27; P = 0.008).

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing has a crucial role in the generation of biological complexity, and its misregulation is often involved in human disease. Here we describe the assembly of a 'splicing code', which uses combinations of hundreds of RNA features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale.},

  Abstract                 = {A massively parallel pyro-sequencing technology commercialized by 454 Life Sciences Corporation was used to sequence the transcriptomes of shoot apical meristems isolated from two inbred lines of maize using laser capture microdissection (LCM). A computational pipeline that uses the POLYBAYES polymorphism detection system was adapted for 454 ESTs and used to detect SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) between the two inbred lines. Putative SNPs were computationally identified using 260 000 and 280 000 454 ESTs from the B73 and Mo17 inbred lines, respectively. Over 36 000 putative SNPs were detected within 9980 unique B73 genomic anchor sequences (MAGIs). Stringent post-processing reduced this number to > 7000 putative SNPs. Over 85% (94/110) of a sample of these putative SNPs were successfully validated by Sanger sequencing. Based on this validation rate, this pilot experiment conservatively identified > 4900 valid SNPs within > 2400 maize genes. These results demonstrate that 454-based transcriptome sequencing is an excellent method for the high-throughput acquisition of gene-associated SNPs.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional transactivator (Tat) recruits the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to the viral promoter. Consisting of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) and cyclin T1, P-TEFb phosphorylates RNA polymerase II and the negative transcription elongation factor to stimulate the elongation of HIV-1 genes. A major fraction of nuclear P-TEFb is sequestered into a transcriptionally inactive 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) by the coordinated actions of the 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induced protein 1 (HEXIM1). In this study, we demonstrate that Tat prevents the formation of and also releases P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP in vitro and in vivo. This ability of Tat depends on the integrity of its N-terminal activation domain and stems from the high affinity interaction between Tat and cyclin T1, which allows Tat to directly displace HEXIM1 from cyclin T1. Furthermore, we find that in contrast to the Tat-independent activation of the HIV-1 promoter, Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription is largely insensitive to the inhibition by HEXIM1. Finally, primary blood lymphocytes display a reduced amount of the endogenous 7SK snRNP upon HIV-1 infection. All these data are consistent with the model that Tat not only recruits but also increases the active pool of P-TEFb for efficient HIV-1 transcription.},

This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS.},

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.},

It was a stepwise achievement that began with the construction of the first functional HCV genome with proven in vivo infectivity. It was then followed by the establishment of subgenomic replicons that self-amplify in cultured human hepatoma cells, and culminated in the generation of infectious HCV upon transfection of these cells with a particular molecular HCV clone designated JFH-1. In this review, we will summarize the development and current state of molecular HCV clones and discuss the prospects and implications of the most recent achievements.},

Although the product of the env gene, gp160/gp120, is known to play a role in cell death mediated by HIV-1, the role of other HIV-1 genes in the process is unclear. We found that HIV-1 lacking the env gene (HIVDeltaenv) still induced apoptosis in T-cell lines and primary CD4 T cells. The ability to induce apoptosis was attributable to Tat, a viral regulatory protein. Tat induction of apoptosis was separate from the transactivation function of Tat, required expression of the second exon of Tat, and was associated with the increased expression and activity of caspase-8 (casp-8), a signaling molecule in apoptotic pathways. Moreover, induction of apoptosis could be prevented by treating cells with an inhibitor of casp-8. In addition, we show that HIV-1Deltaenv infection and Tat expression increased the sensitivity of cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis, an apoptotic pathway that signals via casp-8. The up-regulation of casp-8 by HIV-1 Tat expression may contribute to the increased apoptosis and sensitivity to apoptotic signals observed in the cells of HIV-1-infected persons.},

  Abstract                 = {The interpretation of data-driven experiments in genomics often involves a search for biological categories that are enriched for the responder genes identified by the experiments. However, knowledge bases such as the Gene Ontology (GO) contain hundreds or thousands of categories with very high overlap between categories. Thus, enrichment analysis performed on one category at a time frequently returns large numbers of correlated categories, leaving the choice of the most relevant ones to the user's; interpretation. Here we present model-based gene set analysis (MGSA) that analyzes all categories at once by embedding them in a Bayesian network, in which gene response is modeled as a function of the activation of biological categories. Probabilistic inference is used to identify the active categories. The Bayesian modeling approach naturally takes category overlap into account and avoids the need for multiple testing corrections met in single-category enrichment analysis. On simulated data, MGSA identifies active categories with up to 95\% precision at a recall of 20\% for moderate settings of noise, leading to a 10-fold precision improvement over single-category statistical enrichment analysis. Application to a gene expression data set in yeast demonstrates that the method provides high-level, summarized views of core biological processes and correctly eliminates confounding associations.},

  Abstract                 = {Of all aspects of mRNA maturation the accuracy of intervening sequence excision and exon ligation is, perhaps, the most enigmatic. Attempts to identify the essential elements involved in this process have thus far not yielded any satisfactory answer as to what structural (sequence) features are prerequisite for the vital precision of this process. In our search for underlying structural orders we asked whether exons and introns had any positional preferences within a gene. This analysis led to the unexpected discovery that the DNA length is synchronized between successive 3' splicing sites as well as between successive 5' splicing sites, with a frame of approximately 205 base pairs. This observation reveals additional organization of genes in eukaryotes and, perhaps, links gene splicing with chromatin structure.},

Some recent controlled studies even suggest that the incidence of selected non-ADMs has increased in the HAART era. These trends warrant a high index of suspicion for malignancies among HIV care providers and a renewed focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the increased rates. Potential explanations for the higher non-ADM rates include longer survival of patients with HIV on HAART, with only partial immune recovery achieved in most patients; high incidence of human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and hepatitis C virus coinfection in patients with HIV infection; and potential oncogenicity of long-term HIV infection or of long-term HAART.},

Depending on ethnicity, up to 30\% of the human population carries the provirus on chromosome 19. To facilitate molecular and functional studies, we have cloned the HERV-K113 sequence into a small plasmid vector and characterized its functional properties. Here we show that based on a substantial LTR-promoter activity, full length messenger RNA and spliced env-, rec- and 1.5 kb (hel)-transcripts are produced. The envelope protein of HERV-K113 is synthesized as an 85 kDa precursor that is found partially processed. The accessory Rec protein is highly expressed and accumulates in the nucleus. Expression analysis revealed synthesis of the Gag precursor and the protease. However, the cloned HERV-K113 provirus is not replication competent. It carries inactivating mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene. These mutations can be reversed to reconstitute the active enzyme, but the reversion is not sufficient to reconstitute replication capacity of the virus.},

Gene ontology, biological pathway and protein interaction network analyses were used to identify the higher order biological processes affected by SAHA treatment.Modest modulation by SAHA was observed for 1847 genes with 80\% confidence level of no more than 10\% false positives. A thousand genes were upregulated by SAHA and 847 downregulated. Pathways and gene ontologies overrepresented in the list of differentially expressed genes included Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, tRNA Modification, and the Histone Acetyltransferase Complex. Protein interaction network analysis revealed that transcription factor c-Myc, which was downregulated by SAHA treatment at the mRNA level, interacts with a number of SAHA-responsive genes.The effects on transcription by SAHA were sufficiently modest to support trials to activate HIV replication as part of an eradication strategy. SAHA did not appear to modulate proliferative or apoptotic processes to a great extent, which might impact the ability of patients to eradicate the virus reservoir following activation by HDACi treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Sedimentation analysis and intensity fluctuation spectroscopy have been used in conjunction with the Svedberg equation to determine the particle molecular weights of Rous sarcoma virus (Prague strain) and avian myeloblastosis virus (BAI strain). The molecular weights of these two viruses are (294 +/- 20) x 10(6) and (256 +/- 18) x 10(6), respectively. Values for the molecular weight of the RNA contained in each particle have been calculated as (5.58 +/- 0.5) x 10(6) and (5.88 +/- 0.5) x 10(6). Since the proportion of the viral RNA represented by 4 to 7S low-molecular-weight material is known, the molecular weight of the 60 to 70S genomes may be calculated to lie in the range (3.8 +/- 0.3 to 4.8 +/- 0.4) x 10(6) for both particles. These estimates for the molecular weight of the 60 to 70S genome are much lower than previous estimates and fall within the range of current estimates of the size of a single 35S subunit. The implications of this finding are discussed in terms of current theories for the structure of the genome of RNA tumor viruses.},

High-throughput enabling technologies, particularly large-scale sequencing and splicing-sensitive microarrays, are providing unprecedented opportunities to address key questions in this field. The picture emerging from these pioneering studies is that alternative splicing affects most human genes and a significant fraction of the genes in other multicellular organisms, with the potential to greatly influence the evolution of complex genomes. A combinatorial code of regulatory signals and factors can deploy physiologically coherent programs of alternative splicing that are distinct from those regulated at other steps of gene expression. Pre-mRNA splicing and its regulation play important roles in human pathologies, and genome-wide analyses in this area are paving the way for improved diagnostic tools and for the identification of novel and more specific pharmaceutical targets.},

A cDNA clone producing tev was cloned and expressed in human cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the tev mRNA is generated by splicing to a novel exon located in the env region. This identifies a fourth class of multiply spliced human immunodeficiency virus mRNAs, produced in infected and transfected cells. tev is regulated during the virus life cycle similarly to the other regulatory proteins, tat, rev, and nef, and displays both tat and rev activities in functional assays. Since tev contains important functional domains of tat and rev and is produced very early after transfection, it may be an important regulator in the initial phase of virus expression. Another rev-related protein, p18(6)Drev, containing env and rev sequences, was characterized and was found not to have detectable rev activity.},

Here, we report the evidence that HIV-1 encodes viral siRNA precursors in its genome and that natural HIV-1 infection provokes nucleic acid-based immunity in human cells. To combat this cellular defense, HIV-1 has evolved in its Tat protein a suppressor of RNA silencing (SRS) function. Tat abrogates the cell's RNA-silencing defense by subverting the ability of Dicer to process precursor double-stranded RNAs into siRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {The nef gene product encoded by the mac239 proviral clone of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) markedly enhances viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. We have used this biologically active nef isolate to examine the phenotype of Nef in retrovirally transduced human T cells in culture. SIV Nef is shown to dramatically inhibit cell-surface expression of the CD4 glycoprotein without significantly affecting the total steady-state level of cellular CD4. This downregulation of the cell-surface CD4 receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection correlated with the acquisition of resistance to superinfection by HIV-1. However, SIV Nef did not affect the level of gene expression directed by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. It is hypothesized that downregulation of cell-surface CD4 by Nef facilitates the efficient release of infectious progeny virions and, hence, viral spread in vivo.},

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400–800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30times average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {U1 snRNP (U1), in addition to its splicing role, protects pre-mRNAs from drastic premature termination by cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) at cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in introns. Here, a high-throughput sequencing strategy of differentially expressed transcripts (HIDE-seq) mapped PCPA sites genome wide in divergent organisms. Surprisingly, whereas U1 depletion terminated most nascent gene transcripts within ~1 kb, moderate functional U1 level decreases, insufficient to inhibit splicing, dose-dependently shifted PCPA downstream and elicited mRNA 3' UTR shortening and proximal 3' exon switching characteristic of activated immune and neuronal cells, stem cells, and cancer. Activated neurons' signature mRNA shortening could be recapitulated by U1 decrease and antagonized by U1 overexpression. Importantly, we show that rapid and transient transcriptional upregulation inherent to neuronal activation physiology creates U1 shortage relative to pre-mRNAs. Additional experiments suggest cotranscriptional PCPA counteracted by U1 association with nascent transcripts, a process we term telescripting, ensuring transcriptome integrity and regulating mRNA length.},

Epitopes encoded by alternative reading frame (ARF) peptides may be targeted by CTLs as well, but their frequency and in vivo relevance are unknown. Using host genetic (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]) and plasma viral sequence information from 765 HIV-infected subjects, we identified 64 statistically significant (q<0.2) associations between specific HLA alleles and sequence polymorphisms in alternate reading frames of gag, pol, and nef that did not affect the regular frame protein sequence. Peptides spanning the top 20 HLA-associated imprints were used to test for ex vivo immune responses in 85 HIV-infected subjects and showed responses to 10 of these ARF peptides. The most frequent response recognized an HLA-A*03-restricted +2 frame-encoded epitope containing a unique A*03-associated polymorphism at position 6. Epitope-specific CTLs efficiently inhibited viral replication in vitro when viruses containing the wild-type sequence but not the observed polymorphism were tested. Mutating alternative internal start codons abrogated the CTL-mediated inhibition of viral replication. These data indicate that responses to ARF-encoded HIV epitopes are induced during natural infection, can contribute to viral control in vivo, and drive viral evolution on a population level.},

The mRNA sequences in this fraction were mapped between 51.7 and 61.3 units on the genome by visualizing RNA-DNA hybrids in the electron microscope. When hybrids of hexon mRNA and single-stranded restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of viral DNA were visualized in the electron microscope,branched forms were observed in which 160 nucleotides of RNA from the 5' terminus were not hydrogen bonded to the single-stranded DNA. DNA sequences complementary to the RNA sequences in each 5' tail were found by electron microscopy to be located at 17, 20, and 27 units on the same strand as that coding for the body of the hexon mRNA. Thus, four segments of viral RNA may be joined together during the synthesis of mature hexon mRNA. A model is presented for adenovirus late mRNA synthesis that involves multiple splicing during maturation of a larger precursor nuclear RNA.},

Novel protein-protein interaction domains on acetylated Tat are then established, which are necessary for both sustained transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter and viral transcription elongation. In this study, we investigated the identity of proteins that preferentially bound acetylated Tat. Using a proteomic approach, we identified a number of proteins that preferentially bound AcTat, among which p32, a cofactor of splicing factor ASF/SF-2, was identified. We found that p32 was recruited to the HIV-1 genome, suggesting a mechanism by which acetylation of Tat may inhibit HIV-1 splicing needed for the production of full-length transcripts. Using Tat from different clades, harboring a different number of acetylation sites, as well as Tat mutated at lysine residues, we demonstrated that Tat acetylation affected splicing in vivo. Finally, using confocal microscopy, we found that p32 and Tat colocalize in vivo in HIV-1-infected cells.},

Accumulation of such sequences accounts for at least 40\% of our genome today. These integrating elements are also of interest as gene-delivery vectors for human gene therapy. Here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of integration targeting by HIV, MLV, ASLV, SFV, L1, SB, and AAV. We used a mathematical method which allowed annotation of each base pair in the human genome for its likelihood of hosting an integration event by each type of element, taking advantage of more than 200 types of genomic annotation. This bioinformatic resource documents a wealth of new associations between genomic features and integration targeting. The study also revealed that the length of genomic intervals analyzed strongly affected the conclusions drawn--thus, answering the question "What genomic features affect integration?" requires carefully specifying the length scale of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Phi29 polymerase based amplification methods provides amplified DNA with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. RNA virus detection using microarrays, however, can present a challenge because phi29 DNA polymerase cannot amplify RNA nor small cDNA fragments (<2000 bases) obtained by reverse transcription of certain viral RNA genomes. Therefore, ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29 polymerase based amplification. We adapted the QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (Qiagen) to our purposes and designated the method as Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA).WTA successfully amplified cDNA from a panel of RNA viruses representing the diversity of ribovirus genome sizes. We amplified a range of genome copy numbers from 15 to 4 x 10(7) using WTA, which yielded quantities of amplified DNA as high as 1.2 microg/microl or 10(10) target copies. The amplification factor varied between 10(9) and 10(6). We also demonstrated that co-amplification occurred when viral RNA was mixed with bacterial DNA.This is the first report in the scientific literature showing that a modified WGA (WTA) approach can be successfully applied to viral genomic RNA of all sizes. Amplifying viral RNA by WTA provides considerably better sensitivity and accuracy of detection compared to random RT-PCR.},

  Abstract                 = {CD8+ T cells recognize HIV-1 epitopes translated from a gene's primary reading frame (F1) and any one of its five alternative reading frames (ARFs) in the forward (F2, F3) or reverse (R1-3) directions. The 3' end of HIV-1's proviral coding strand contains a conserved sequence that is directly overlapping but antiparallel to the env gene (ARF R2) and encodes for a putative antisense HIV-1 protein called ASP. ASP expression has been demonstrated in vitro using HIV-transfected cell lines or infected cells. Although antibodies to ASP were previously detected in patient sera, T cell recognition of ASP-derived epitopes has not been evaluated. We therefore investigated the ex vivo and in vitro induction of ASP-specific T cell responses as a measure of immune recognition and protein expression during HIV-1 infection.A panel of overlapping peptides was initially designed from the full-length ASP sequence to perform a global assessment of T cell responses. Recognition of ASP-derived antigens was evaluated in an IFN-γELISpot assay using PBMCs from HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative individuals. Eight of 25 patients had positive responses to ASP antigens and none of the seronegative donors responded. As a complimentary approach, a second set of antigens was designed using HLA-I binding motifs and affinities. Two ASP-derived peptides with high predicted binding affinities for HLA-A*02 (ASP-YL9) and HLA-B*07 (ASP-TL10) were tested using PBMCs from HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative individuals who expressed the matching HLA-I-restricting allele. We found that HLA-I-restricted ASP peptides were only recognized by CD8+ T cells from patients with the relevant HLA-I and did not induce responses in any of the seronegative donors or patients who do not express the restrictive HLA alleles. Further, ASP-YL9-specific CD8+ T cells had functional profiles that were similar to a previously described HLA-A*02-restricted epitope (Gag-SL9). Specific recognition of ASP-YL9 by CD8+ T cells was also demonstrated by tetramer staining using cells from an HLA-A*02 HIV-infected patient.Our results provide the first description of CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses to ASP in HIV-1-infected patients, demonstrating that ASP is expressed during infection. Our identification of epitopes within ASP has implications for designing HIV vaccines.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:454 pyrosequencing is a commonly used massively parallel DNA sequencing technology with a wide variety of application fields such as epigenetics, metagenomics and transcriptomics. A well-known problem of this platform is its sensitivity to base-calling insertion and deletion errors, particularly in the presence of long homopolymers. In addition, the base-call quality scores are not informative with respect to whether an insertion or a deletion error is more likely. Surprisingly, not much effort has been devoted to the development of improved base-calling methods and more intuitive quality scores for this platform.We present HPCall, a 454 base-calling method based on a weighted Hurdle Poisson model. HPCall uses a probabilistic framework to call the homopolymer lengths in the sequence by modeling well-known 454 noise predictors. Base-calling quality is assessed based on estimated probabilities for each homopolymer length, which are easily transformed to useful quality scores.Using a reference data set of the Escherichia coli K-12 strain, we show that HPCall produces superior quality scores that are very informative towards possible insertion and deletion errors, while maintaining a base-calling accuracy that is better than the current one. Given the generality of the framework, HPCall has the potential to also adapt to other homopolymer-sensitive sequencing technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies suggest that human endogenous retrovirus group K (HERV-K) provirus expression plays a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In particular, RNA from the HML-2 subgroup of HERV-K proviruses has been reported to be highly expressed at the cellular level and detectable in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients, suggestive of virion production and, perhaps, replication. In this study, we developed an HML-2-specific quantitative-PCR assay that detects 51 of the 89 known HML-2 proviruses in the human genome. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-negative controls and HIV-1-infected patients were collected for analysis of HML-2 RNA expression. Contrary to previous reports, we did not detect high levels of HML-2 RNA in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients, but we did observe a significant increase of HML-2 RNA in total PBMCs compared to HIV-negative controls. The level of HML-2 expression in PBMCs does not appear to be related to patient use of antiretrovirals or to HIV-1 plasma RNA, cellular RNA, or cellular DNA levels. To investigate the source of HML-2 RNA expression, patient PBMCs were sorted into CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD8+, CD3- CD14+, and CD3- CD20+ cell subsets and then analyzed for HML-2 RNA levels. No single cell subset was enriched for HML-2 RNA expression in HIV-1-infected patients, but there appears to be substantial variability in the level of HML-2 expression depending on the cell type.Here, we report that human endogenous retrovirus group K (HERV-K) (HML-2) proviruses are expressed at significantly higher levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with HIV-1 infection than in those from uninfected individuals. However, contrary to previous reports, this expression did not lead to detectable virions in the plasma of these patients. In addition, we found that HML-2 proviruses were expressed in multiple blood cell types from HIV-1-infected individuals, and the magnitude of HML-2 expression was not related to HIV-1 disease markers in this patient cohort. These findings may have implications for HML-2-based therapies targeting HIV-1 infection.},

  Abstract                 = {The synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNAs is a complex process by which more than 30 different mRNA species are produced by alternative splicing of a single primary RNA transcript. HIV-1 splice sites are used with significantly different efficiencies, resulting in different levels of mRNA species in infected cells. Splicing of Tat mRNA, which is present at relatively low levels in infected cells, is repressed by the presence of exonic splicing silencers (ESS) within the two tat coding exons (ESS2 and ESS3). These ESS elements contain the consensus sequence PyUAG. Here we show that the efficiency of splicing at 3' splice site A2, which is used to generate Vpr mRNA, is also regulated by the presence of an ESS (ESSV), which has sequence homology to ESS2 and ESS3. Mutagenesis of the three PyUAG motifs within ESSV increases splicing at splice site A2, resulting in increased Vpr mRNA levels and reduced skipping of the noncoding exon flanked by A2 and D3. The increase in Vpr mRNA levels and the reduced skipping also occur when splice site D3 is mutated toward the consensus sequence. By in vitro splicing assays, we show that ESSV represses splicing when placed downstream of a heterologous splice site. A1, A1(B), A2, and B1 hnRNPs preferentially bind to ESSV RNA compared to ESSV mutant RNA. Each of these proteins, when added back to HeLa cell nuclear extracts depleted of ESSV-binding factors, is able to restore splicing repression. The results suggest that coordinate repression of HIV-1 RNA splicing is mediated by members of the hnRNP A/B protein family.},

Here, we use ultradeep pyrosequencing to create a comprehensive picture of CD8+ T-lymphocyte (CD8-TL) escape in SIV-infected macaques, revealing a previously undetected complex pattern of viral variants. This increased sensitivity enabled the detection of acute CD8-TL escape as early as 17 days postinfection, representing the earliest published example of CD8-TL escape in intrarectally infected macaques. These data demonstrate that pyrosequencing can be used to study the evolution of CD8-TL escape during immunodeficiency virus infection with an unprecedented degree of sensitivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by short interfering RNA has opened up new directions in the phenotypic mutation of cellular genes. However, its efficacy on non-nuclear genes and its effect on the interferon pathway remain unexplored. Since directed mutation of RNA genomes is not possible through conventional mutagenesis, we have tested sequence-specific 21-nucleotide long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) for their ability to silence cytoplasmic RNA genomes.Short dsRNAs were generated against specific mRNAs of respiratory syncytial virus, a nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA virus with a cytoplasmic life cycle. At nanomolar concentrations, the dsRNAs specifically abrogated expression of the corresponding viral proteins, and produced the expected mutant phenotype ex vivo. The dsRNAs did not induce an interferon response, and did not inhibit cellular gene expression. The ablation of the viral proteins correlated with the loss of the specific mRNAs. In contrast, viral genomic and antigenomic RNA, which are encapsidated, were not directly affected.Synthetic inhibitory dsRNAs are effective in specific silencing of RNA genomes that are exclusively cytoplasmic and transcribed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. RNA-directed RNA gene silencing does not require cloning, expression, and mutagenesis of viral cDNA, and thus, will allow the generation of phenotypic null mutants of specific RNA viral genes under normal infection conditions and at any point in the infection cycle. This will, for the first time, permit functional genomic studies, attenuated infections, reverse genetic analysis, and studies of host-virus signaling pathways using a wild type RNA virus, unencumbered by any superinfecting virus.},

Both proteins act to overcome the block to viral structural gene expression, at least in part, by reversing the inhibitory effect of intronic RNA sequences, termed cis-acting repressive (CRS) sequences. Using HTLV type II (HTLV-II) as a model, we recently showed that the function of a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) CRS correlates with in vitro binding by both polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB) protein (also known as hnRNP I) and hnRNP A1 to CRS RNA (1,2). Using radioimmunoprecipitation of proteins ultraviolet (UV) crosslinked to each HIV CRS RNA with monoclonal anti-hnRNP antibodies, we now demonstrate that hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 bind to two different HIV-1 CRS RNAs. In addition, we show that hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 binding to HIV-1 CRS RNAs can be specifically competed by HTLV-II CRS RNAs using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)/UV crosslinking assays. Binding by both hnRNP I and hnRNP A1 to HIV-1 and HTLV-II CRS RNAs suggests a role for these proteins in CRS function that may be influenced by the Rev and Rex proteins, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid progression to AIDS after acute infection with a multidrug-resistant (MDR), dual-tropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was reported in a New York City man (hereafter referred to as "NYC") who has sex with men. The probable source of this HIV-1 (hereafter referred to as "CT01") and the development of a recombinant MDR HIV-1 in the source's partner (hereafter referred to as "CT02") are described.After identification of the epidemiological link of CT01 and CT02 to NYC, viral sequences and phenotypic analyses were compared. Confirmatory genotypic and phenotypic analyses, replicative capacity, and viral coreceptor use were assessed. Viral recombination was assessed using a sliding window technique and phylogenetic tree analysis.NYC and CT01 were linked historically and epidemiologically and were genetically confirmed from CT01's samples acquired 2 days before and subsequent to the transmission event. Genotypic, recombination, and phylogenetic analyses suggest CT02 became superinfected by CT01 with subsequent production of a recombinant panresistant HIV-1.The probable source of a dual-tropic, MDR HIV-1 that was associated with rapid progression to AIDS is illustrated, suggesting progression was not explained by the HIV-1 variant alone. A probable second finding of a chronically infected host becoming superinfected with MDR HIV-1 with subsequent formation of a panresistant recombinant HIV-1 is described. This case illustrates the public health implications of unsafe sex between serodiscordant and seroconcordant partners.},

  Abstract                 = {The multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus (MSRV) isolated from plasma of MS patients was found to be phylogenetically and experimentally related to human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). To characterize the MSRV-related HERV family and to test the hypothesis of a replication-competent HERV, we have investigated the expression of MSRV-related sequences in healthy tissues. The expression of MSRV-related transcripts restricted to the placenta led to the isolation of overlapping cDNA clones from a cDNA library. These cDNAs spanned a 7.6-kb region containing gag, pol, and env genes; RU5 and U3R flanking sequences; a polypurine tract; and a primer binding site (PBS). As this PBS showed similarity to avian retrovirus PBSs used by tRNATrp, this new HERV family was named HERV-W. Several genomic elements were identified, one of them containing a complete HERV-W unit, spanning all cDNA clones. Elements of this multicopy family were not replication competent, as gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs) were interrupted by frameshifts and stop codons. A complete ORF putatively coding for an envelope protein was found both on the HERV-W DNA prototype and within an RU5-env-U3R polyadenylated cDNA clone. Placental expression of 8-, 3.1-, and 1.3-kb transcripts was observed, and a putative splicing strategy was described. The apparently tissue-restricted HERV-W long terminal repeat expression is discussed with respect to physiological and pathological contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {The therapeutic potential of pharmacologic inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins has recently emerged in hematological malignancies and chronic inflammation. We find that BET inhibitor compounds (JQ1, I-Bet, I-Bet151 and MS417) reactivate HIV from latency. This is evident in polyclonal Jurkat cell populations containing latent infectious HIV, as well as in a primary T-cell model of HIV latency. Importantly, we show that this activation is dependent on the positive transcription elongation factor p-TEFb but independent from the viral Tat protein, arguing against the possibility that removal of the BET protein BRD4, which functions as a cellular competitor for Tat, serves as a primary mechanism for BET inhibitor action. Instead, we find that the related BET protein, BRD2, enforces HIV latency in the absence of Tat, pointing to a new target for BET inhibitor treatment in HIV infection. In shRNA-mediated knockdown experiments, knockdown of BRD2 activates HIV transcription to the same extent as JQ1 treatment, while a lesser effect is observed with BRD4. In single-cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, quantitative analyses across ~2,000 viral integration sites confirm the Tat-independent effect of JQ1 and point to positive effects of JQ1 on transcription elongation, while delaying re-initiation of the polymerase complex at the viral promoter. Collectively, our results identify BRD2 as a new Tat-independent suppressor of HIV transcription in latently infected cells and underscore the therapeutic potential of BET inhibitors in the reversal of HIV latency.},

  Abstract                 = {It has recently been estimated that a single HIV-1 infected cell produces between and more than viral particles over its life span. Since body-wide estimates of the ratio of free virus to productively infected cells are smaller than and much smaller than , individual virions must be cleared rapidly. This seems difficult to reconcile with the fact that most of the total body virus is trapped on follicular dendritic cells where it can survive for many months. It has also been difficult to reconcile the vast difference in the rates at which the virus is cleared from the blood in rhesus macaques and in chronically infected patients. Here we attempt to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations by considering the virion clearance rate in various organs and the virion exchange rates between them. The main results are that the per capita clearance rate of free virus in lymphoid tissue should be fast, the virion exchange rate between lymphoid tissue and the blood should be slow, and the comparatively slow previous estimates for the virion clearance rate from the blood correspond to the rate of virion efflux from the blood to other organs where the virus is ultimately cleared.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcription of the HIV-1 genome yields a single primary transcript, which is alternatively spliced to >30 mRNAs. Productive infection depends on inefficient and regulated splicing and appears to proceed in a tight 5' to 3' order. To analyse whether sequential splicing is mediated by the quality of splice sites or by the position of an intron, we inserted the efficient beta-globin intron (BGI) into the 3' region or 5'UTR of a subgenomic expression vector or an infectious proviral plasmid. RNA analysis revealed splicing of the 3' BGI only if all upstream introns were removed, while splicing of the same intron in the 5'UTR was efficient and independent of further splicing. Furthermore, mutation of the upstream splice signal in the subgenomic vector did not eliminate the inhibition of 3' splicing, although the BGI sequence was the only intron in this case. These results suggest that downstream splicing of HIV-1 RNAs is completely dependent on prior splicing of all upstream intron(s). This hypothesis was supported by the mutation of the major 5' splice site in the HIV-1 genome, which completely abolished all splicing. It appears likely that the tight order of splicing is important for HIV-1 replication, which requires the stable production of intron containing RNAs, while splicing of 3' introns on incompletely spliced RNAs would be likely to render them subject to nonsense-mediated decay.},

  Abstract                 = {Gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors are promising tools for gene therapy, but they can be oncogenic. The development of safer vectors depends on a quantitative assay for insertional mutagenesis. Here we report a rapid, inexpensive, and reproducible assay which uses a murine cell line to measure the frequency of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent mutants. Lentiviral and gammaretroviral vectors cause insertional mutagenesis at similar frequencies; however, they use different mechanisms. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vectors generate mutants by insertion only into the growth hormone receptor (Ghr) locus. The HIV enhancer/promoter is active in the absence of the HIV Tat protein in this locus, and an HIV/Ghr spliced transcript expresses GHR and cells respond to GH. Deletion of the enhancer/promoter in a self-inactivating HIV-based vector prevents this mechanism of insertional mutagenesis. In contrast, gammaretroviral vectors insert into other loci, including IL-3 and genes identified as common insertion sites in the Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD).},

  Abstract                 = {Differentiated human teratocarcinoma cell lines produce the human teratocarcinoma-derived virus (HTDV) particles encoded by the human endogenous retrovirus sequence HERV-K. We screened almost 2,000 human sera for antibodies against this endogenous human retrovirus, HTDV/HERV-K. Specificity of the immunofluorescence reactions using particle producing teratocarcinoma cells was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy of ultrathin frozen sections. Immunoblot analyses using lysates of HTDV-producing cells revealed a 80-kDa HERV-K Gag precursor and a 90-kDa putative viral Env protein after incubation with positive sera. No processed Gag protein could be observed. Virus-specific bands were not detected in lysates of nonproducing cells. High antibody titers were found in about 60\% of male patients with germ cell tumors. Antibody reactivity declined after tumor removal. In healthy blood donors, anti-HTDV reactivity was found only at low titers in a small percentage (3.9\%) of individuals. A slightly elevated but statistically significant percentage of HTDV positivity was also observed for sera of pregnant women, whereas human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals exhibited no peculiarity compared to normal blood donors. Our results provide evidence that HTDV particles are expressed in vivo and that the immune reaction against HTDV/HERV-K is specific for defined viral proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Technological advances in DNA recovery and sequencing have drastically expanded the scope of genetic analyses of ancient specimens to the extent that full genomic investigations are now feasible and are quickly becoming standard. This trend has important implications for infectious disease research because genomic data from ancient microbes may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes of pestilence-associated mortality in London, England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient organism is ancestral to most extant strains and sits very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis commonly associated with human infection. Temporal estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351 was the main historical event responsible for the introduction and widespread dissemination of the ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived increased virulence of the disease during the Black Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype. These findings support the notion that factors other than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding emerging Y. pestis infections.},

Studies of viral latency in vivo are complicated by the low frequency of latently infected cells found in HIV-1 patients. To be able to study the signaling pathways and viral determinants of latency and reactivation, we have developed a novel method that generates high numbers of latently HIV-1 infected cells, which are derived from human primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes. This method allows for the study of different aspects of HIV-1 latency, such as the transcription factors needed for viral reactivation and the signaling pathways involved. In this review, we describe in detail an experimental protocol for the generation of HIV-1 latency using human primary CD4(+) T cells. We also present the salient points of other latency models in the field, along with key findings arising from each model.},

In this work, we describe an ex vivo experimental system that generates high levels of HIV-1 latently infected memory cells using primary CD4+ T cells. Using this model, we were able to dissect the T cell-signaling pathways and to characterize the long terminal repeat (LTR) cis-acting elements involved in reactivation of HIV-1 in memory CD4+ T cells. We conclude that Lck and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), but not NF-kappaB, are required for optimal latent virus reactivation in memory T cells. We also found that the cis-acting elements which are critical toward HIV-1 reactivation are the Sp1 and kappaB/NFAT transcription factor binding sites.},

Using both productively and defectively infected clones of U937 cells, we assessed the effect of CD4-gp160 intracellular association on the maturation of both proteins. Pulse-chase labeling followed by sequential immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the processing of both free and associated CD4 and gp160, and the results showed that the trimming, proteolytic cleavage, and degradation of gp160 were completely abrogated after intracellular binding to CD4. Similarly, the maturation process which normally transforms 80\% of CD4 to a partially endoglycosidase H-resistant species was also impaired subsequent to the formation of these complexes. A comparison of gp160 maturation either in free form or as a CD4 complex revealed that neither inefficient transport nor degradation of gp160 can account for the observed blockage of CD4 maturation. Moreover, this impairment was independent of gp120 and gp41, since a defective clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cells, unable to cleave gp160, showed binding of CD4 and inhibition of CD4 transport and maturation with the same efficiency as occurred in productively infected cells. Expression of gp160 is thus necessary and sufficient to cause CD4 receptor down-modulation for both productively and defectively infected cells.},

  Abstract                 = {We have recently demonstrated that coexpression of Vpu and CD4 in HeLa cells results in the degradation of CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum. The sensitivity of CD4 to Vpu-mediated degradation is conferred by the presence of specific sequences located between amino acids 402 and 420 in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain. Using an in vitro translation system, we also showed that degradation of CD4 by Vpu requires the two proteins to be present in the same membrane compartment. Although these results suggest that spatial proximity between CD4 and Vpu may be critical in triggering degradation, it remains unknown whether the two molecules have the ability to interact with each other. In order to better define the mechanisms involved in CD4 degradation, we investigated the existence and functional relevance of direct interactions between CD4 and Vpu. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Vpu specifically binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4. This phenomenon is relevant to the mechanism of CD4 degradation since the ability of CD8/CD4 chimeric molecules and various CD4 mutants to form complexes with Vpu correlates with their sensitivity to degradation. Accordingly, we found that amino acid residues in the CD4 cytoplasmic tail previously shown to be important for degradation are necessary for Vpu binding. We further demonstrate that a deletion mutant of Vpu as well as a phosphorylation mutant, both biologically inactive with regard to CD4 degradation, retained the capacity to interact with the CD4 cytoplasmic domain. Taken together, these results indicate that Vpu binding is necessary to trigger CD4 degradation. However, the binding to target molecules is not sufficient per se to cause degradation. Interaction between CD4 and Vpu is thus likely to be an early event critical in triggering a multistep process leading to CD4 degradation.},

To understand this process better, we have examined the native state of viral DNA in cells acutely infected by murine leukemia virus (MLV), using both a physical assay for viral DNA and a functional assay for integration activity (Brown et al. 1987). The viral DNA and integration activity copurify during velocity sedimentation, gel filtration, and density equilibrium centrifugation, indicating that viral DNA is in a large (approximately 160S) nucleoprotein complex that includes all functions required for integration activity in vitro. Analysis by immunoprecipitation shows that the viral capsid protein is part of the active nucleoprotein complex, but recognition of the complex by only a subset of anti-capsid sera implies that the protein is constrained conformationally. The viral DNA within this structure is accessible to nucleases; the effects of nucleases on the integrity of the complex suggest that the integration-competent particle is derived from and similar to the core of extracellular virions.},

Integration site data sets were then compared to each other and to computationally generated random distributions.HIV integration was favored in active transcription units in both cell types, but integration sites from activated cells were found more often in genomic regions that were dense in genes, dense in CpG islands, and enriched in G/C bases. Integration sites from activated cells were also more strongly correlated with histone methylation patterns associated with active genes.These data indicate that integration site distributions show modest but significant differences between resting and activated CD4 T cells, and that integration in resting cells occurs more often in regions that may be suboptimal for proviral gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {At least 8\% of the human genome was formed by integration of retroviral DNA sequences. Here we analyze the forces directing the accumulation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) by comparing de novo HERV integration targeting with the distribution of fixed HERV elements in the human genome. All known genomic HERVs are inactive due to mutation, but we were able to study integration targeting using a reconstituted consensus HERV-K (designated HERV-K(Con)). We found that HERV-K(Con) integrated preferentially in transcription units, in gene-rich regions, and near features associated with active transcription units and associated regulatory regions. In contrast, genomic HERV-K proviruses are found preferentially outside transcription units. The minority of genomic HERVKs present inside transcription units are in opposite transcriptional orientation relative to the host gene, the orientation predicted to be minimally disruptive to host mRNA synthesis, but de novo HERV-K(Con) integration within transcription units showed no orientation bias. We also found that the youngest HERV-K elements in the human genome showed a distribution intermediate between de novo HERV-K(Con) integration sites and older fixed HERV-Ks. These findings indicate that accumulation of HERVs in the human germline is a two-step process: integration targeting biases direct initial accumulation, then purifying selection leads to loss of proviruses disrupting gene function.},

We performed a large-scale small interfering RNA screen to identify host factors required by HIV-1 and identified more than 250 HIV-dependency factors (HDFs). These proteins participate in a broad array of cellular functions and implicate new pathways in the viral life cycle. Further analysis revealed previously unknown roles for retrograde Golgi transport proteins (Rab6 and Vps53) in viral entry, a karyopherin (TNPO3) in viral integration, and the Mediator complex (Med28) in viral transcription. Transcriptional analysis revealed that HDF genes were enriched for high expression in immune cells, suggesting that viruses evolve in host cells that optimally perform the functions required for their life cycle. This effort illustrates the power with which RNA interference and forward genetics can be used to expose the dependencies of human pathogens such as HIV, and in so doing identify potential targets for therapy.},

GT resulted in partial or complete resolution of immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and bleeding diathesis. Analysis of retroviral insertion sites revealed >140,000 unambiguous integration sites and a polyclonal pattern of hematopoiesis in all patients early after GT. Seven patients developed acute leukemia [one acute myeloid leukemia (AML), four T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and two primary T-ALL with secondary AML associated with a dominant clone with vector integration at the LMO2 (six T-ALL), MDS1 (two AML), or MN1 (one AML) locus]. Cytogenetic analysis revealed additional genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations. This study shows that hematopoietic stem cell GT for WAS is feasible and effective, but the use of γ-retroviral vectors is associated with a substantial risk of leukemogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor RNAs is responsible for greatly expanding the regulatory and functional capacity of eukaryotic genomes. Of the different classes of AS, intron retention (IR) is the least well understood. In plants and unicellular eukaryotes, IR is the most common form of AS, whereas in animals, it is thought to represent the least prevalent form. Using high-coverage poly(A)(+) RNA-seq data, we observe that IR is surprisingly frequent in mammals, affecting transcripts from as many as three-quarters of multiexonic genes. A highly correlated set of cis features comprising an "IR code" reliably discriminates retained from constitutively spliced introns. We show that IR acts widely to reduce the levels of transcripts that are less or not required for the physiology of the cell or tissue type in which they are detected. This "transcriptome tuning" function of IR acts through both nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and nuclear sequestration and turnover of IR transcripts. We further show that IR is linked to a cross-talk mechanism involving localized stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and reduced availability of spliceosomal components. Collectively, the results implicate a global checkpoint-type mechanism whereby reduced recruitment of splicing components coupled to Pol II pausing underlies widespread IR-mediated suppression of inappropriately expressed transcripts.},

This reservoir is believed to be a source of the residual viremia and is the focus of eradication efforts. Here, we use two measures of population structure--analysis of molecular variance and the Slatkin-Maddison test--to demonstrate that the residual viremia is genetically distinct from proviruses in resting CD4(+) T cells but that proviruses in resting and activated CD4(+) T cells belong to a single population. Residual viremia is genetically distinct from proviruses in activated CD4(+) T cells, monocytes, and unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The finding that some of the residual viremia in patients on HAART stems from an unidentified cellular source other than CD4(+) T cells has implications for eradication efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a novel sequencing approach that combines non-gel-based signature sequencing with in vitro cloning of millions of templates on separate 5 microm diameter microbeads. After constructing a microbead library of DNA templates by in vitro cloning, we assembled a planar array of a million template-containing microbeads in a flow cell at a density greater than 3x10(6) microbeads/cm2. Sequences of the free ends of the cloned templates on each microbead were then simultaneously analyzed using a fluorescence-based signature sequencing method that does not require DNA fragment separation. Signature sequences of 16-20 bases were obtained by repeated cycles of enzymatic cleavage with a type IIs restriction endonuclease, adaptor ligation, and sequence interrogation by encoded hybridization probes. The approach was validated by sequencing over 269,000 signatures from two cDNA libraries constructed from a fully sequenced strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and by measuring gene expression levels in the human cell line THP-1. The approach provides an unprecedented depth of analysis permitting application of powerful statistical techniques for discovery of functional relationships among genes, whether known or unknown beforehand, or whether expressed at high or very low levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are viruses that have colonized the germ line and spread through vertical passage. Only the more recently acquired HERVs, such as the HERV-K (HML-2) group, maintain coding open reading frames. Expression of HERV-Ks has been linked to different pathological conditions, including HIV infection, but our knowledge on which specific HERV-Ks are expressed in primary lymphocytes currently is very limited. To identify the most expressed HERV-Ks in an unbiased manner, we analyzed their expression patterns in peripheral blood lymphocytes using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. We observe that three HERV-Ks (KII, K102, and K18) constitute over 90\% of the total HERV-K expression in primary human lymphocytes of five different donors. We also show experimentally that two of these HERV-K env sequences (K18 and K102) retain their ability to produce full-length and posttranslationally processed envelope proteins in cell culture. We show that HERV-K18 Env can be incorporated into HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) particles. Moreover, HERV-K18 Env incorporation into HIV-1 virions is dependent on HIV-1 matrix. Taken together, we generated high-resolution HERV-K expression profiles specific for activated human lymphocytes. We found that one of the most abundantly expressed HERV-K envelopes not only makes a full-length protein but also specifically interacts with HIV-1. Our findings raise the possibility that these endogenous retroviral Env proteins could directly influence HIV-1 replication.Here, we report the HERV-K expression profile of primary lymphocytes from 5 different healthy donors. We used a novel deep-sequencing technology (PacBio SMRT) that produces the long reads necessary to discriminate the complexity of HERV-K expression. We find that primary lymphocytes express up to 32 different HERV-K envelopes, and that at least two of the most expressed Env proteins retain their ability to make a protein. Importantly, one of them, the envelope glycoprotein of HERV-K18, is incorporated into HIV-1 in an HIV matrix-specific fashion. The ramifications of such interactions are discussed, as the possibility of HIV-1 target tissue broadening and immune evasion are considered.},

We describe general methods for improved quality scores and accurate automated polymorphism detection, and apply them to data from the Roche (454) Genome Sequencer 20. We assess our methods using known-truth data sets, which is critical to the validity of the assessments. We developed informative, base-by-base error predictors for this sequencer and used a variant of the phred binning algorithm to combine them into a single empirically derived quality score. These quality scores are more useful than those produced by the system software: They both better predict actual error rates and identify many more high-quality bases. We developed a SNP detection method, with variants for low coverage, high coverage, and PCR amplicon applications, and evaluated it on known-truth data sets. We demonstrate good specificity in single reads, and excellent specificity (no false positives in 215 kb of genome) in high-coverage data.},

  Abstract                 = {Viral protein R (Vpr) of HIV-1 belongs to a class of so called 'accessory' proteins, originally thought to be dispensable for virus replication, at least in vitro. Indeed, viruses with mutated or deleted Vpr replicate well in transformed T cell lines. However, recently published results reveal several important functions performed by Vpr, which are critical for HIV-1 replication in vivo. Vpr plays an important role in regulating nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex, and is required for virus replication in non-dividing cells. Vpr also induces cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells, stimulates virus transcription, and regulates activation and apoptosis of infected cells. These diverse functions are mediated by the interaction of Vpr with different cellular proteins, many of which carry the WxxF amino acid motif. The molecular events underlying the activity of Vpr are reviewed in this article.},

The ability of HIV-1 to replicate in non-dividing cells is partly accounted for by the karyophilic properties of the viral preintegration complex which, after virus infection, is actively transported to the host cell nucleus. Here we report that the gag matrix protein of HIV-1 contains a nuclear localization sequence which, when conjugated to a heterologous protein, directs its nuclear import. In addition, HIV-1 mutants containing amino-acid substitutions in this nuclear localization signal integrate and replicate within dividing but not growth-arrested cells, and thus display a phenotype more representative of an oncoretrovirus.},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined components of the preintegration complex of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and have analyzed features which govern the association of these components. HIV-1 nucleoprotein complexes, isolated from nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of CD4+ cells after acute virus infection, contained viral RNA and DNA in association with viral matrix (MA), integrase (IN), and reverse transcriptase (RT) antigens but not capsid (CA) antigens and possessed integration activity in vitro. Association of IN but not RT or MA antigens with viral DNA was detergent-stable. Analysis of viral DNA synthesis and nuclear import of viral nucleoprotein complexes in the presence of a reversible RT inhibitor demonstrated that reverse transcription of viral RNA could be completed entirely in the host cell nucleus. Our studies demonstrate structural and functional features of the nucleoprotein (preintegration) complex of HIV-1 which are pertinent to the understanding of early events in the lentiviral life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 persists in a latent reservoir despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). This reservoir is the major barrier to HIV-1 eradication. Current approaches to purging the latent reservoir involve pharmacologic induction of HIV-1 transcription and subsequent killing of infected cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or viral cytopathic effects. Agents that reverse latency without activating T cells have been identified using in vitro models of latency. However, their effects on latently infected cells from infected individuals remain largely unknown. Using a new ex vivo assay, we demonstrate that none of the latency-reversing agents (LRAs) tested induced outgrowth of HIV-1 from the latent reservoir of patients on ART. Using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay specific for all HIV-1 mRNAs, we demonstrate that LRAs that do not cause T cell activation do not induce substantial increases in intracellular HIV-1 mRNA in patient cells; only the protein kinase C agonist bryostatin-1 caused significant increases. These findings demonstrate that current in vitro models do not fully recapitulate mechanisms governing HIV-1 latency in vivo. Further, our data indicate that non-activating LRAs are unlikely to drive the elimination of the latent reservoir in vivo when administered individually.},

  Abstract                 = {The splicing of precursors to mRNAs occurs in two steps, both involving single transesterification reactions (Fig. 1). The first step generates a 2′ – 5′ bond at the branch site upstream of the 3′ splice site and a free 3′ hydroxyl group on the 5′ exon. The resulting lariat RNA intermediate, with its slow migration in gels, is the most common assay for splicing in vitro. In the second step, attack of the 3′ hydroxyl on the phosphodiester bond at the 3′ splice site displaces the lariat intron with a 3′ hydroxyl group and results in joining of the two exons. The bimolecular nature of the intermediate in splicing indicated that the reaction must occur within a stable splicing body or spliceosome. Surprisingly, assembly and functioning of the spliceosome requires approximately 100 polypeptides and five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), not considering gene-specific RNA-binding factors. There are two distinct types of spliceosomes in most cells. The major class or U2-type spliceosome is universal in eukaryotes, whereas the minor class or U12-type spliceosome may not be present in some organisms. The evolutionary relationship of these two spliceosomes is uncertain.<p>The sequence specificity for the splicing of introns must be encoded within the gene. In vertebrate genes, particularly for U2-type introns, the sequence specificity for splicing is not determined solely by the consensus sequences at the intron boundaries but is more broadly distributed within the gene. In contrast, the consensus sequences of the introns in the yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> are generally adequate to specify...},

  Abstract                 = {In a program screening civilian applicants for U.S. military service for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we studied the frequency of false positive diagnoses retrospectively among applicants seropositive for HIV in a subpopulation with a very low prevalence of infection. That subpopulation was defined as consisting of all applicants tested between October 16, 1985, and June 30, 1987, who were young (17 or 18 years of age) and resided in a rural county in a state with a low incidence of reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 135,187). Serum specimens from 15 applicants positive for HIV in this low-prevalence subpopulation were retrieved from a serum bank and retested by two Western blot methods, radioimmunoprecipitation, and an immunoassay constructed from a molecularly cloned and expressed viral envelope polypeptide. Fourteen of the 15 samples were unequivocally positive on all retest assays, and 1 was negative. Thus, the measured rate of false positive diagnoses in this program was 1 in 135,187 persons tested. Factors important in achieving a low false positive rate were redundant, multistep testing algorithm, conservative criteria for interpreting Western blots, the requirement that a second, newly drawn serum specimen be tested for verification before a diagnosis of HIV was considered established, and tight quality control of laboratory testing procedures. We conclude that a screening program for HIV infection in a low-prevalence population can have an acceptably low false positive rate.},

  Abstract                 = {A database (SpliceDB) of known mammalian splice site sequences has been developed. We extracted 43 337 splice pairs from mammalian divisions of the gene-centered Infogene database, including sites from incomplete or alternatively spliced genes. Known EST sequences supported 22 815 of them. After discarding sequences with putative errors and ambiguous location of splice junctions the verified dataset includes 22 489 entries. Of these, 98.71\% contain canonical GT-AG junctions (22 199 entries) and 0.56\% have non-canonical GC-AG splice site pairs. The remainder (0.73\%) occurs in a lot of small groups (with a maximum size of 0.05\%). We especially studied non-canonical splice sites, which comprise 3.73\% of GenBank annotated splice pairs. EST alignments allowed us to verify only the exonic part of splice sites. To check the conservative dinucleotides we compared sequences of human non-canonical splice sites with sequences from the high throughput genome sequencing project (HTG). Out of 171 human non-canonical and EST-supported splice pairs, 156 (91.23\%) had a clear match in the human HTG. They can be classified after sequence analysis as: 79 GC-AG pairs (of which one was an error that corrected to GC-AG), 61 errors corrected to GT-AG canonical pairs, six AT-AC pairs (of which two were errors corrected to AT-AC), one case was produced from a non-existent intron, seven cases were found in HTG that were deposited to GenBank and finally there were only two other cases left of supported non-canonical splice pairs. The information about verified splice site sequences for canonical and non-canonical sites is presented in SpliceDB with the supporting evidence. We also built weight matrices for the major splice groups, which can be incorporated into gene prediction programs.

  Abstract                 = {A set of 43 337 splice junction pairs was extracted from mammalian GenBank annotated genes. Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences support 22 489 of them. Of these, 98.71\% contain canonical dinucleotides GT and AG for donor and acceptor sites, respectively; 0.56\% hold non-canonical GC-AG splice site pairs; and the remaining 0.73\% occurs in a lot of small groups (with a maximum size of 0.05\%). Studying these groups we observe that many of them contain splicing dinucleotides shifted from the annotated splice junction by one position. After close examination of such cases we present a new classification consisting of only eight observed types of splice site pairs (out of 256 a priori possible combinations). EST alignments allow us to verify the exonic part of the splice sites, but many non-canonical cases may be due to intron sequencing errors. This idea is given substantial support when we compare the sequences of human genes having non-canonical splice sites deposited in GenBank by high throughput genome sequencing projects (HTG). A high proportion (156 out of 171) of the human non-canonical and EST-supported splice site sequences had a clear match in the human HTG. They can be classified after corrections as: 79 GC-AG pairs (of which one was an error that corrected to GC-AG), 61 errors that were corrected to GT-AG canonical pairs, six AT-AC pairs (of which two were errors that corrected to AT-AC), one case was produced from non-existent intron, seven cases were found in HTG that were deposited to GenBank and finally there were only two cases left of supported non-canonical splice sites. If we assume that approximately the same situation is true for the whole set of annotated mammalian non-canonical splice sites, then the 99.24\% of splice site pairs should be GT-AG, 0.69\% GC-AG, 0.05\% AT-AC and finally only 0.02\% could consist of other types of non-canonical splice sites. We analyze several characteristics of EST-verified splice sites and build weight matrices for the major groups, which can be incorporated into gene prediction programs. We also present a set of EST-verified canonical splice sites larger by two orders of magnitude than the current one (22 199 entries versus approximately 600) and finally, a set of 290 EST-supported non-canonical splice sites. Both sets should be significant for future investigations of the splicing mechanism.},

Here we present a simple in vitro system that carries out the integration reaction and the use of this system to probe the mechanism of integration. The only HIV protein necessary is the integration (IN) protein, which has been overexpressed in insect cells and then partially purified. DNA substrates are supplied as oligonucleotides that match the termini of the linear DNA product of reverse transcription. In the presence of HIV IN protein, oligonucleotide substrates are cleaved to generate the recessed 3' ends that are the precursor for integration, and the cleaved molecules are efficiently inserted into a DNA target. Analysis of reaction products reveals that HIV IN protein joins 3' ends of the viral DNA to 5' ends of cuts made by IN protein in the DNA target. We have also used this assay to characterize the sequences at the ends of the viral DNA involved in integration. The assay provides a simple screen for testing candidate inhibitors of HIV IN protein; some such inhibitors might have useful antiviral activity.},

As a first step in analyzing the mechanism of integration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA, a cell-free system was established that models the integration reaction. The in vitro system depends on the HIV integration (IN) protein, which was partially purified from insect cells engineered to express IN protein in large quantities. Integration was detected in a biological assay that scores the insertion of a linear DNA containing HIV terminal sequences into a lambda DNA target. Some integration products generated in this assay contained five-base pair duplications of the target DNA at the recombination junctions, a characteristic of HIV integration in vivo; the remaining products contained aberrant junctional sequences that may have been produced in a variation of the normal reaction. These results indicate that HIV IN protein is the only viral protein required to insert model HIV DNA sequences into a target DNA in vitro.},

Combining all genes from the genome-wide studies together with genes reported in the literature to affect HIV yields 2,410 protein-coding genes, or fully 9.5\% of all human genes (though of course some of these are false positive calls). Here we report an "encyclopedia" of all overlaps between studies (available at http://www.hostpathogen.org), which yielded a more extensively corroborated set of host factors assisting HIV replication. We used these genes to calculate refined networks that specify cellular subsystems recruited by HIV to assist in replication, and present additional analysis specifying host cell genes that are attractive as potential therapeutic targets.},

In the solution dimer structure, the monomers exhibit different relative orientations compared to previous X-ray structures. The solution structure fits well into the EM density map, suggesting that the dimer interface is retained in the assembled CA. We also identified a CTD-CTD interface at the local three-fold axis in the cryoEM map and confirmed its functional importance by mutagenesis. In the tubular assembly, CA intermolecular interfaces vary slightly, accommodating the asymmetry present in tubes. This provides the necessary plasticity to allow for controlled virus capsid dis/assembly.},

Using comparative genomics and quantitative microarray profiling, we performed the first global analysis of alternative splicing differences between humans and chimpanzees. Surprisingly, 6\%-8\% of profiled orthologous exons display pronounced splicing level differences in the corresponding tissues from the two species. Little overlap is observed between the genes associated with alternative splicing differences and the genes that display steady-state transcript level differences, indicating that these layers of regulation have evolved rapidly to affect distinct subsets of genes in humans and chimpanzees. The alternative splicing differences we detected are predicted to affect diverse functions including gene expression, signal transduction, cell death, immune defense, and susceptibility to diseases. Differences in expression at the protein level of the major splice variant of Glutathione S-transferase omega-2 (GSTO2), which functions in the protection against oxidative stress and is associated with human aging-related diseases, suggests that this enzyme is less active in human cells compared with chimpanzee cells. The results of this study thus support an important role for alternative splicing in establishing differences between humans and chimpanzees.},

  Abstract                 = {Although it is a standard practice in high-income countries, determination of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load is not recommended in developing countries because of the costs and technical constraints. As more and more countries establish capacity to provide second-line therapy, and as costs and technological constraints associated with viral load testing decrease, the question of whether determination of the viral load is necessary deserves attention. Viral load testing could increase in importance as a guide for clinical decisions on when to switch to second-line treatment and on how to optimize the duration of the first-line treatment regimen. In addition, the viral load is a particularly useful tool for monitoring adherence to treatment, performing sentinel surveillance, and diagnosing HIV infection in children aged <18 months. Rather than considering viral load data to be an unaffordable luxury, efforts should be made to ensure that viral load testing becomes affordable, simple, and easy to use in resource-limited settings.},

Here, we report that uORFs correlate with significantly reduced protein expression of the downstream ORF, based on analysis of 11,649 matched mRNA and protein measurements from 4 published mammalian studies. Using reporter constructs to test 25 selected uORFs, we estimate that uORFs typically reduce protein expression by 30-80\%, with a modest impact on mRNA levels. We additionally identify polymorphisms that alter uORF presence in 509 human genes. Finally, we report that 5 uORF-altering mutations, detected within genes previously linked to human diseases, dramatically silence expression of the downstream protein. Together, our results suggest that uORFs influence the protein expression of thousands of mammalian genes and that variation in these elements can influence human phenotype and disease.},

HIV-1 infection leads to apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells and the direct killing of HIV-infected cells. This is mediated, in part, by the HIV-1 Tat protein, which is secreted by virally infected cells and taken up by uninfected cells. We chemically synthesized two 86-residue subtype D Tat proteins, Ug05RP and Ug11LTS, from two Ugandan patients who were clinically categorized as either rapid progressor or long-term survivor, with non-conservative mutations located essentially in the glutamine-rich region. Structural heterogeneities were revealed by CD, which translate into differing trans-activational and apoptotic effects. CD data analysis and molecular modeling indicated that the short alpha-helix observed in subtype D Tat proteins from rapid progressor patients such as Tat Mal and Tat Ug05RP is not present in Ug11LTS. We show that Tat Ug05RP is more efficient than Tat Ug11LTS in its trans-activational role and in inducing apoptosis in binding tubulin via the mitochondrial pathway. The glutamine-rich region of Tat appears to be involved in the Tat-mediated apoptosis of T-cells.},

All subclones within a cancer are phylogenetically related, with the prevalence of each subclone determined by its evolutionary fitness and the timing of its origin relative to other subclones. Recently developed massively parallel sequencing platforms promise the ability to detect rare subclones of genetic variants without a priori knowledge of the mutations involved. We used ultra-deep pyrosequencing to investigate intraclonal diversification at the Ig heavy chain locus in 22 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis of a non-polymorphic control locus revealed artifactual insertions and deletions resulting from sequencing errors and base substitutions caused by polymerase misincorporation during PCR amplification. We developed an algorithm to differentiate genuine haplotypes of somatic hypermutations from such artifacts. This proved capable of detecting multiple rare subclones with frequencies as low as 1 in 5000 copies and allowed the characterization of phylogenetic interrelationships among subclones within each patient. This study demonstrates the potential for ultra-deep resequencing to recapitulate the dynamics of clonal evolution in cancer cell populations.},

These cell lines harbor the viral genome but produce only very low levels of viral progeny, which can be increased by stimulation with agents such as phorbol ester and cytokines. As such, they provide an in vitro model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 latency. In order to examine the basis for their latent state, we have analyzed the activity of endogenous Tat protein in these cells and investigated the effect on viral replication of the addition of exogenous Tat protein. We find that U1 cells seem to have levels of Tat protein that are suboptimal for long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription, because transcription from a transfected LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid can be enhanced by cotransfection of a Tat expression plasmid. Furthermore, viral replication can be stimulated in this cell line by incubation with purified Tat protein. In contrast, ACH-2 cells are not limited for LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcription by endogenous levels of Tat, and virus production is not increased by the addition of exogenous Tat protein. By semiquantitative PCR analysis of viral RNA, we have demonstrated that Tat protein caused an increase in human immunodeficiency virus RNA expression in U1 cells but had no effect in ACH-2 cells. This suggests that a different mechanism underlies the latent state in U1 and ACH-2 cells.},

A fully infected population showed a relatively high frequency of low-level infection, with 40\% of subcloned cells being negative by reverse transcriptase and p24 indirect immunofluorescence analysis and displaying only low levels of supernatant p24. The same treatment of a T-lymphoid cell line produced 100\% productive infections. HIV-1 infection of HL-60 did not appear to alter the state of differentiation of the cells, as assessed by surface antigen expression, regardless of the level of viral expression. Furthermore, infected cells were able to respond normally to chemical inducers of differentiation. Induction of differentiation towards monocyte/macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate activated the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in a transient transfection system, and there was a corresponding increase in viral production from the infected subclones. Granulocytic differentiation, as stimulated by dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid, had no effect on long terminal repeat activity and did not stimulate viral replication. These data suggest that low-level HIV-1 infections may be established at a relatively high frequency in myeloid precursor cells, and that different pathways of promyelocytic differentiation vary in their ability to stimulate HIV-1 replication.},

  Abstract                 = {Retroviruses use different strategies to regulate transcription and translation and exploit the cellular machinery involved in these processes. This study shows that the signal peptide of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) plays a major role in posttranscriptional viral gene expression. Expression of the JSRV Env in trans increases viral particle production by mechanisms dependent on (i) its leader sequence, (ii) an intact signal peptide cleavage site, (iii) a cis-acting RNA-responsive element located in the viral genome, (iv) Crm1, and (v) B23. The signal peptide of the JSRV Env (JSE-SP) is 80 amino acid residues in length and contains putative nuclear localization and export signals, in addition to an arginine-rich RNA binding motif. JSE-SP localizes both in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with nucleolar markers. JSE-SP is a multifunctional protein, as it moderately enhances nuclear export of unspliced viral mRNA and considerably increases viral particle release by favoring a posttranslational step of the replication cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {The integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome is transcribed in a single pre-mRNA that is alternatively spliced into more than 40 mRNAs. We characterized a novel bidirectional exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) that regulates the expression of the HIV-1 env, vpu, rev, and nef mRNAs. The ESE is localized downstream of the vpu-, env-, and nef-specific 3' splice site no. 5. SF2/ASF and SRp40 activate the ESE and are required for efficient 3' splice site usage and binding of the U1 snRNP to the downstream 5' splice site no. 4. U1 snRNP binding to the 5' splice site no. 4 is required for splicing of the rev and nef mRNAs and to increase expression of the partially spliced env mRNA. Finally, our results indicate that this ESE is necessary for the recruitment of the U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site no. 4, even when the 5' splice site and the U1 snRNA have been mutated to obtain a perfect complementary match. The ESE characterized here is highly conserved in most viral subtypes.},

  Abstract                 = {A naturally arising point mutation in the env gene of HIV-1 activates the aberrant inclusion of the cryptic exon 6D into most viral messages, leading to inefficient viral replication. We set out to understand how a single nucleotide substitution could cause such a dramatic change in splicing. We have determined that the exon 6D mutation promotes binding of the SR protein SC35 to the exon. Mutant exon 6D sequences function as a splicing enhancer when inserted into an enhancer-dependent splicing construct. hnRNP H family proteins bind to the enhancer as well; their binding is dependent on the sequence GGGA located just downstream of the point mutation and depletion-- reconstitution studies show that hnRNP H is essential for enhancer activity. A polypurine sequence located further downstream in exon 6D binds SR proteins but acts as an exonic splicing silencer. hnRNP H is required for interaction of U1 snRNP with the enhancer, independent of the point mutation. We propose that SC35 binding to the point mutation region may convert the hnRNP H-U1 snRNP complex into a splicing enhancer.},

However, the HIV-1 genome contains alternative reading frames (ARFs) potentially encoding small polypeptides. We have identified a panel of epitopes encoded by ARFs within the gag, pol, and env genes. The corresponding epitopic peptides were immunogenic in mice humanized for MHC-I molecules. In addition, cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognizing these epitopes were found in HIV-infected patients. These results reveal the existence of atypical mechanisms of HIV-1 epitope generation. They indicate that the repertoire of epitopes recognized by the cellular anti-HIV-1 immune response is broader than initially thought. This should be taken into account when designing vaccine strategies aimed at activating these responses.},

Here we analyze HIV-1 transcripts generated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected individuals by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of RNA extracted from unstimulated cells. We identify several unusual or unreported transcripts, most of them splicing within the Nef coding sequence. The majority are predicted to code for a Nef C-terminal 34 amino acid peptide, but others code for Vpr, a truncated Tat, and a 41 amino acid peptide encoded in an antisense exon. We also identify nef and env transcripts splicing four nucleotides downstream of SA5. These results represent the first report on the in vivo generation of diverse novel HIV-1-spliced transcripts, frequently encoding a Nef C-terminal peptide.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGF-R2) transcripts involves the mutually exclusive usage of exons IIIb and IIIc to produce two different receptor isoforms. Appropriate splicing of exon IIIb in rat prostate cancer DT3 cells requires a previously described cis element (ISAR, for "intronic splicing activator and repressor") which represses the splicing of exon IIIc and activates the splicing of exon IIIb. This element is nonfunctional in rat prostate AT3 cells, which repress exon IIIb inclusion and splice to exon IIIc. We have now identified an intronic element upstream of exon IIIb that causes repression of exon IIIb splicing. Deletion of this element abrogates the requirement for ISAR in order for exon IIIb to be spliced in DT3 cells and causes inappropriate inclusion of exon IIIb in AT3 cells. This element consists of two intronic splicing silencer (ISS) sequences, ISS1 and ISS2. The ISS1 sequence is pyrimidine rich, and in vitro cross-linking studies demonstrate binding of polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) to this element. Competition studies demonstrate that mutations within ISS1 that abolish PTB binding in vitro alleviate splicing repression in vivo. Cotransfection of a PTB-1 expression vector with a minigene containing exon IIIb and the intronic splicing silencer element demonstrate PTB-mediated repression of exon IIIb splicing. Furthermore, all described PTB isoforms were equally capable of mediating this effect. Our results support a model of splicing regulation in which exon IIIc splicing does not represent a default splicing pathway but rather one in which active repression of exon IIIb splicing occurs in both cells and in which DT3 cells are able to overcome this repression in order to splice exon IIIb.},

The effect of a point mutation within a coding sequence is traditionally attributed to the deduced change in the corresponding amino acid. However, some point mutations can have much more severe effects on the structure of the encoded protein, for example when they inactivate an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), thereby resulting in exon skipping. ESEs also appear to be especially important in exons that normally undergo alternative splicing. Different classes of ESE consensus motifs have been described, but they are not always easily identified. ESEfinder (http://exon.cshl.edu/ESE/) is a web-based resource that facilitates rapid analysis of exon sequences to identify putative ESEs responsive to the human SR proteins SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55, and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV infection of macrophages is a critically important component of viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Although the virus follows the same life cycle in macrophages and T lymphocytes, several aspects of the virus-host relationship are unique to macrophage infection. Examples of these are the long-term persistence of productive infection, sustained by the absence of cell death, and the ability of progeny virus to bud into and accumulate in endocytic compartments designated multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Recently, the hypothesis that viral exploitation of the macrophage endocytic machinery is responsible for perpetuating the chronic state of infection unique to this cell type has been challenged in several independent studies employing a variety of experimental strategies. This review examines the evidence supporting and refuting the canonical hypothesis and highlights recently identified cellular factors that may contribute to the unique aspects of the HIV-macrophage interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV infection of mononuclear phagocytes (MP), mostly as tissue macrophages, is a dominant feature in the pathogenesis of HIV disease and its progression to AIDS. Although the general mechanism of infection is not dissimilar to that of CD4+ T lymphocytes occurring via interaction of the viral envelope with CD4 and a chemokine receptor (usually CCR5), other features are peculiar to MP infection. Among others, the long-term persistence of productive infection, sustained by the absence of substantial cell death, and the capacity of the virions to bud and accumulate in intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVB), has conferred to MP the role of "Trojan horses" perpetuating the chronic state of infection. Because the investigation of tissue macrophages is often very difficult for both ethical and practical reasons of accessibility, most studies of in vitro infection rely upon monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), a methodology hampered by inter-patient variability and lack of uniformity of experimental protocols. A number of cell lines, mostly Mono Mac, THP-1, U937, HL-60, and their derivative chronically infected counterparts (such as U1 and OM-10.1 cell lines) have complemented the MDM system of infection providing useful information on the features of HIV replication in MP. This article describes and compares the most salient features of these different cellular models of MP infection by HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {The β-haemoglobinopathies are the most prevalent inherited disorders worldwide. Gene therapy of β-thalassaemia is particularly challenging given the requirement for massive haemoglobin production in a lineage-specific manner and the lack of selective advantage for corrected haematopoietic stem cells. Compound β(E)/β(0)-thalassaemia is the most common form of severe thalassaemia in southeast Asian countries and their diasporas. The β(E)-globin allele bears a point mutation that causes alternative splicing. The abnormally spliced form is non-coding, whereas the correctly spliced messenger RNA expresses a mutated β(E)-globin with partial instability. When this is compounded with a non-functional β(0) allele, a profound decrease in β-globin synthesis results, and approximately half of β(E)/β(0)-thalassaemia patients are transfusion-dependent. The only available curative therapy is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although most patients do not have a human-leukocyte-antigen-matched, geno-identical donor, and those who do still risk rejection or graft-versus-host disease. Here we show that, 33 months after lentiviral β-globin gene transfer, an adult patient with severe β(E)/β(0)-thalassaemia dependent on monthly transfusions since early childhood has become transfusion independent for the past 21 months. Blood haemoglobin is maintained between 9 and 10 g dl(-1), of which one-third contains vector-encoded β-globin. Most of the therapeutic benefit results from a dominant, myeloid-biased cell clone, in which the integrated vector causes transcriptional activation of HMGA2 in erythroid cells with further increased expression of a truncated HMGA2 mRNA insensitive to degradation by let-7 microRNAs. The clonal dominance that accompanies therapeutic efficacy may be coincidental and stochastic or result from a hitherto benign cell expansion caused by dysregulation of the HMGA2 gene in stem/progenitor cells.},

CT can have important prevention benefits; however, in 1995, 25\% of persons testing HIV-positive and 33\% of persons testing HIV-negative at publicly funded clinics did not return for their test results. Rapid tests to detect HIV antibody can be performed in an average of 10 minutes, enabling health-care providers to supply definitive negative and preliminary positive results to patients at the time of testing, potentially increasing the overall effectiveness of CT. In comparison, results from enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) currently used for HIV screening often are not available for 1-2 weeks. To quantify the potential advantages and disadvantages of using rapid tests for CT, CDC estimated the potential impact on the number of persons who would learn their HIV-test results. This report summarizes the results of the analysis and provides the basis for changing the Public Health Service (PHS) recommendations for providing HIV-test results.},

Yet, in a recent LV-based clinical trial for β-thalassemia, vector integration within the HMGA2 gene induced the formation of an aberrantly spliced mRNA form that appeared to cause clonal dominance. Using a method that we developed, cDNA linear amplification-mediated PCR, in combination with high-throughput sequencing, we conducted a whole transcriptome analysis of chimeric LV-cellular fusion transcripts in transduced human lymphoblastoid cells and primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We observed a surprising abundance of read-through transcription originating outside and inside the provirus and identified the vector sequences contributing to the aberrant splicing process. We found that SIN LV has a sharply reduced propensity to engage in aberrant splicing compared with that of vectors carrying active LTRs. Moreover, by recoding the identified vector splice sites, we reduced residual read-through transcription and demonstrated an effective strategy for improving vectors. Characterization of the mechanisms and genetic features underlying vector-induced aberrant splicing will enable the generation of safer vectors, with low impact on the cellular transcriptome.},

Viral entry and gene expression were described to be the key determinants for cell permissiveness to HIV. Recent reports highlighted the involvement of miRNA in regulating HIV-1 replication post-transcriptionally. In this study we explored the role of cellular factors required for miRNA-mediated mRNA translational inhibition in regulating HIV-1 gene expression. Here we show that HIV-1 mRNAs associate and co-localize with components of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), and we characterize some of the proteins required for miRNA-mediated silencing (miRNA effectors). RCK/p54, GW182, LSm-1 and XRN1 negatively regulate HIV-1 gene expression by preventing viral mRNA association with polysomes. Interestingly, knockdown of RCK/p54 or DGCR8 resulted in virus reactivation in PBMCs isolated from HIV infected patients treated with suppressive HAART.},

These mutant RNAs accumulated in the nucleus as unspliced precursors owing to recognition by splicing components. Only in the presence of Rev did these unspliced RNAs appear in the cytoplasm.

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) contains binding sites for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1, both of which are highly conserved in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates. To delineate the effects of these motifs on the replicative capacity of HIV and to explore the possibility of extending the virus host range, known heterologous enhancer/promoters were inserted into the HIV-1 LTR in place of the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites. The effects of these substitutions on viral replication in transfected HeLa cells and on HIV infection of human peripheral blood lymphocytes or continuous T-leukemia cell lines were evaluated. HIVs in which the NF-kappa B/Sp1 enhancer plus the downstream TATA element were replaced with heterologous enhancer/promoters were also constructed. Viruses containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer exhibited infectious kinetics similar to that of wild-type HIV in activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and AA2 cells but replicated less efficiently in H9 and CEM cells. These studies indicate that heterologous enhancer elements are capable of restoring Tat responsiveness to the HIV LTR in the context of directing reporter gene expression as well as in the production of infectious progeny virions.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables the highly sensitive measurement of whole transcriptomes. We report the first application to our knowledge of this technology to the analysis of RNA from a CD4+ T cell line infected with intact HIV. We sequenced the total mRNA from infected cells and detected differences in the expression of both host and viral mRNA. Viral reads represented a large portion of the total mapped sequencing reads: approximately 20\% at 12 h postinfection (hpi) and 40\% at 24 hpi. We also detected a small but significant suppression of T cell activation-related genes at 12 hpi. This suppression persisted and expanded by 24 hpi, providing new possible markers of virus-induced T cell cytopathology. By 24 hpi, the expression of over 50\% of detectable host loci was also altered, indicating widespread alteration of host processes, including RNA processing, splicing, and transport to an extent not previously reported. In addition, next-generation sequencing provided insights into alternative viral RNA splice events and the expression of noncoding RNAs, including microRNA host genes. IMPORTANCE: Recent advances in sequencing technology now allow the measurement of effectively all the RNA in a cell. This approach is especially useful for studying models of virus infection, as it allows the simultaneous measurement of both host and viral RNA. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we measured changes in total mRNA from a HIV-infected T cell line. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this technology to the investigation of HIV-host interactions involving intact HIV. We directly measured the amount of viral mRNA in infected cells and detected novel viral RNA splice variants and changes in the host expression of noncoding RNA species. We also detected small changes in T cell activation and other host processes during the early stages of viral replication that increased near the peak of viral replication, providing new candidate biomarkers of T cell death.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV infection of CD4(+) T cells induces a range of host transcriptional changes in mRNAs as well as microRNAs that may coordinate changes in mRNAs. To survey these dynamic changes, we applied next-generation sequencing, analyzing the small RNA fraction of HIV-infected cells at 5, 12, and 24 h postinfection (RNA-Seq). These time points afforded a view of the transcriptomic changes occurring both before and during viral replication. In the resulting small RNA-Seq data set, we detected a phased pattern of microRNA expression. Largely distinct sets of microRNAs were found to be suppressed at 5 and 12 h postinfection, and both sets of changes rebounded later in infection. A larger set of microRNA changes was observed at 24 h postinfection. When integrated with mRNA expression data, the small RNA-Seq data indicated a role for microRNAs in transcriptional regulation, T cell activation, and cell cycle during HIV infection. As a unique benefit of next-generation sequencing, we also detected candidate novel host microRNAs differentially expressed during infection, including one whose downregulation at 24 h postinfection may allow full replication of HIV to proceed. Collectively, our data provide a uniquely comprehensive view of the changes in host microRNAs induced by HIV during cellular infection. IMPORTANCE New sequencing technologies allow unprecedented views into changes occurring in virus-infected cells, including comprehensive and largely unbiased measurements of different types of RNA. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to profile dynamic changes in cellular microRNAs occurring in HIV-infected cells. The sensitivity afforded by sequencing allowed us to detect changes in microRNA expression early in infection, before the onset of viral replication. A phased pattern of expression was evident among these microRNAs, and many that were initially suppressed were later overexpressed at the height of infection, providing unique signatures of infection. By integrating additional mRNA data with the microRNA data, we identified a role for microRNAs in transcriptional regulation during infection and specifically a network of microRNAs involved in the expression of a known HIV cofactor. Finally, as a distinct benefit of sequencing, we identified candidate nonannotated microRNAs, including one whose downregulation may allow HIV-1 replication to proceed fully.},

HIV immunoassays for screening and diagnosis are now in their fourth generation; an assay generation meaning that significant modifications to the assay format have led to a significant enhancement in quality. Although still not perfect, they are now of exceptionally high quality if conducted properly. Most problems relate to how the assays are performed. Many laboratories, especially in high human development index (HDI) countries, manage testing within functioning quality-management systems, but this is not true of laboratories in low HDI countries or in many medium HDI countries. Simple rapid tests for HIV are being used increasingly, and create special challenges for assuring quality. Users of HIV immunoassays are learning that a poorer assay used well has better outcomes than a splendid assay performed poorly. Experience highlights the importance of conducting HIV testing within quality-managed systems and according to international standards, but testing quality and laboratory quality management must be funded adequately.},

All mothers and infants received perinatal prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine and 1 week of zidovudine plus lamivudine. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the cumulative risk of HIV-1 transmission or death by 28 weeks among infants who were HIV-1-negative 2 weeks after birth. Rates were compared with the use of the log-rank test.Among mother-infant pairs, 5.0\% of infants were HIV-1-positive at 2 weeks of life. The estimated risk of HIV-1 transmission between 2 and 28 weeks was higher in the control group (5.7\%) than in either the maternal-regimen group (2.9\%, P=0.009) or the infant-regimen group (1.7\%, P<0.001). The estimated risk of infant HIV-1 infection or death between 2 and 28 weeks was 7.0\% in the control group, 4.1\% in the maternal-regimen group (P=0.02), and 2.6\% in the infant-regimen group (P<0.001).

Four Mamu-A*01 rhesus macaques were inoculated on two occasions 11 weeks apart with the scSIV by ex vivo infection and i.v. reinfusion of autologous cells. After each inoculation, plasma viral loads peaked between 1 and 2.5 days and then declined exponentially in one or two phases to below detection limits within 2 weeks. Although higher levels of SIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and modest increases in antibody responses were observed for each animal after the second inoculation, decay rates of the infected cells were only minimally affected. Analyzing the viral load data with a mathematical model, the in vivo viral burst size averaged 4.0 x 10(4) and 5.5 x 10(4) virions per cell for the first and second inoculations, respectively, with no significant difference between the two inoculations. This estimate, in conjunction with our prior understanding of other quantitative viral and cellular parameters during SIV and HIV infection, provides critical insights into the dynamic process of viral production and its interplay with the infected host in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating bacterial community composition from a mixed sample in different applied contexts is an important task for many microbiologists. The bacterial community composition is commonly estimated by clustering polymerase chain reaction amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences. Current taxonomy-independent clustering methods for analyzing these sequences, such as UCLUST, ESPRIT-Tree and CROP, have two limitations: (i) expert knowledge is needed, i.e. a difference cutoff between species needs to be specified; (ii) closely related species cannot be separated. The first limitation imposes a burden on the user, since considerable effort is needed to select appropriate parameters, whereas the second limitation leads to an inaccurate description of the underlying bacterial community composition. We propose a probabilistic model-based method to estimate bacterial community composition which tackles these limitations. Our method requires very little expert knowledge, where only the possible maximum number of clusters needs to be specified. Also our method demonstrates its ability to separate closely related species in two experiments, in spite of sequencing errors and individual variations.},

After clustering and assembly, a total of 184,599 unique sequences were generated containing over 400 SSRs. The 454 sequences generated hits to more genes than a comparable amount of sequence from MtGI. Although short, the 454 reads are of sufficient length to map to a unique genome location as effectively as longer ESTs produced by conventional sequencing. Functional interpretation of the sequences was carried out by Gene Ontology assignments from matches to Arabidopsis and was shown to cover a broad range of GO categories. 53,796 assemblies and singletons (29\%) had no match in the existing MtGI. Within the previously unobserved Medicago transcripts, thousands had matches in a comprehensive protein database and one or more of the TIGR Plant Gene Indices. Approximately 20\% of these novel sequences could be found in the Medicago genome sequence. A total of 70,026 reads generated by the 454 technology were mapped to 785 Medicago finished BACs using PASA and over 1,000 gene models required modification. In parallel to 454 sequencing, 4,445 5'-prime reads were generated by conventional sequencing using the same library and from the assembled sequences it was shown to contain about 52\% full length cDNAs encoding proteins from 50 to over 500 amino acids in length.Due to the large number of reads afforded by the 454 DNA sequencing technology, it is effective in revealing the expression of transcripts from a broad range of GO categories and contains many rare transcripts in normalized cDNA libraries, although only a limited portion of their sequence is uncovered. As with longer ESTs, 454 reads can be mapped uniquely onto genomic sequence to provide support for, and modifications of, gene predictions.},

The mediators which regulate the resting or quiescent phenotype are often actively involved in the restriction of viral replication and the establishment and maintenance of viral latency. Recently, certain microRNAs which are highly expressed in resting cells have been implicated in this capacity, inhibiting the expression of cellular proteins that are also viral co-factors; following activation these microRNAs exhibit decreased expression, while their targets are correspondingly up-regulated, contributing to a favorable milieu for virus replication. Other microRNAs exhibiting a similar expression pattern in resting and activated cells have been shown to directly target the HIV-1 genome. In this review we will discuss the resting state and the causes behind viral restriction in resting cells, with emphasis on the role of microRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {The replication of integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is dependent on the cellular cofactor cyclin T1, which binds the viral Tat protein and activates the RNA polymerase II transcription of the integrated provirus. The activation of resting CD4(+) T cells upregulates cyclin T1 protein levels independently of an increase in cyclin T1 mRNA levels, suggesting a translational repression of cyclin T1 in resting CD4(+) T cells. Hypothesizing that microRNAs (miRNAs) repress cyclin T1 translation in resting CD4(+) T cells and that this inhibition is lifted upon cell activation, we used microarray expression analysis to identify miRNAs miR-27b, miR-29b, miR-150, and miR-223 as being significantly downregulated upon CD4(+) T cell activation. The overexpression of these miRNAs decreased endogenous cyclin T1 protein levels, while treatment with the corresponding antagomiRs increased cyclin T1 protein levels. An miR-27b binding site within the cyclin T1 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) was identified and confirmed to be functional after the mutation of key resides abrogated the ability of miR-27b to decrease the expression of a luciferase reporter upstream of the cyclin T1 3'UTR. Ago2 immunoprecipitation revealed an association with cyclin T1 mRNA that was decreased following treatment with miR-27b and miR-29b antagomiRs. Cells overexpressing miR-27b showed decreased viral gene expression levels of the HIV-1 reporter virus and a decreased replication of strain NL4.3; a partial rescue of viral transcription could be seen following the transfection of cyclin T1. These results implicate miR-27b as a novel regulator of cyclin T1 protein levels and HIV-1 replication, while miR-29b, miR-223, and miR-150 may regulate cyclin T1 indirectly.},

While studying 65 patients with lymphoblastic leukemia whose karyotype was determined at diagnosis, we compared the findings in 8 patients with lymphomatous ALL and 57 patients whose presentations were more typical of ALL. Six patients with lymphomatous ALL had karyotypic abnormalities leading to loss of bands p21-p22 on the short arm of chromosome 9. The mechanisms varied and included deletions, unbalanced translocations, or loss of the entire chromosome. Only 1 of the 57 patients without lymphomatous ALL had an abnormality of chromosome 9 at diagnosis (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that loss of chromosomal material in the region of 9p21-p22 is closely associated with lymphomatous ALL; by analogy with retinoblastoma, in which gene deletions are associated with an enzyme deficiency, this disease may be related to the loss of the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, previously reported in some of these patients.},

Both the epidemiology of HIV-2 and the colonial history of West Africa appear more complex, but similar conditions existed there and may have contributed to the origin of HIV-2. Focusing the search for the origins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 on this earlier time period may contribute to understanding the evolution of the HIV viruses and the dynamics of emerging diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined the ability of chemokine receptors and related G protein-coupled receptors to facilitate infection by primary, clinical HIV-1 isolates. CCR5, when expressed along with CD4, the HIV-1 receptor, allowed cell lines resistant to most primary HIV-1 isolates to be infected. CCR3 facilitated infection by a more restricted subset of primary viruses, and binding of the CCR3 ligand, eotaxin, inhibited infection by these isolates. Utilization of CCR3 and CCR5 on the target cell depended upon the sequence of the third variable (V3) region of the HIV-1 gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein. The ability of various members of the chemokine receptor family to support the early stages of HIV-1 infection helps to explain viral tropism and beta-chemokine inhibition of primary HIV-1 isolates.},

This has been observed by forming RNA displacement loops (R loops) between Ad2 DNA and unfractionated polysomal RNA from infected cells. The 5' terminal sequences of mRNAs in R loops, variously located between positions 36 and 92, form complex secondary hybrids with single-stranded DNA from restriction endonuclease fragments containing sequences to the left of position 36 on the Ad2 genome. The structures visualized in the electron microscope show that short sequences coded at map positions 16.6, 19.6 and 26.6 on the R strand are joined to form a leader sequence of 150-200 nucleotides at the 5' end of many late mRNAs. A late mRNA which maps to the left of position 16.6 shows a different pattern of second site hybridization. It contains sequences from 4.9-6.0 linked directly to those from 9.6-10.9. These findings imply a new mechanism for the biosynthesis of Ad2 mRNA in mammalian cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Wild-type reverse transcriptase has evolved for the survival of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by natural selection. In contrast, therapy relying on inhibitors of reverse transcriptase by nucleosides like zidovudine (AZT) or dideoxyinosine (ddI), and by non-nucleosides like pyridinones or nevirapine, may exert different selection pressures on this enzyme. Therefore the acquisition of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors by selection of mutations in the pol gene may require compromises in enzyme function that affect viral replication. As single mutations are unlikely to confer broad resistance when combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors are used, multiple mutations may occur that result in further compromises. Certain drug combinations may prevent the co-existence of adequate reverse transcription function and multi-drug resistance (MDR). Unlike bacterial or eukaryotic drug resistance, retroviral drug resistance is conferred only by mutations in its own genome and is limited by genome size. Combining drugs directed against the same essential viral protein may thus prevent HIV-1 MDR, whereas the conventional approach of targeting different HIV-1 proteins for combination therapy may not, because genomes with resistance mutations in different HIV-1 genes might recombine to develop MDR. Here we show that several mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene that confer resistance to inhibitors of this enzyme can attenuate viral replication. We tested whether combinations of mutations giving rise to single-agent resistance might further compromise or even abolish viral replication, and if multidrug-resistant viruses could be constructed. Certain combinations of mutations conferring resistance to AZT, ddI and pyridinone are incompatible with viral replication. These results indicate that evolutionary limitations exist to restrict development of MDR. Furthermore, a therapeutic strategy exploiting these limitations by using selected multidrug regimens directed against the same target may prevent development of MDR. This approach, which we call convergent combination therapy, eliminated HIV-1 replication and virus breakthrough in vitro, and may be applicable to other viral targets. Moreover, elimination of reverse transcription by convergent combination therapy may also limit MDR.},

We also discuss the critical need to collect detailed epidemiological data in real-time during the course of an ongoing epidemic, carry out further studies to estimate the effectiveness of interventions during past outbreaks and the ongoing epidemic, and develop large-scale modeling studies to study the spread and control of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the context of the highly heterogeneous economic reality of African countries.},

Uncertainty remains over what fraction of CD4+ T cells are infected and whether there are latent reservoirs for the virus. We show here that during the asymptomatic phase of infection there is an extremely low total body load of latently infected resting CD4+ T cells with replication-competent integrated provirus (<10(7) cells). The most prevalent form of HIV-1 DNA in resting and activated CD4+ T cells is a full-length, linear, unintegrated form that is not replication competent. The infection progresses even though at any given time in the lymphoid tissues integrated HIV-1 DNA is present in only a minute fraction of the susceptible populations, including resting and activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages.},

In the majority of patients examined, the rebounding plasma virus was genetically distinct from both the cell-associated HIV RNA and the replication-competent virus within the detectable pool of latently infected, resting CD4 + T cells.

It is not clear, however, whether the establishment of a pool of latently infected CD4(+) T cells can be blocked by early initiation of HAART after primary infection. The present study demonstrates that initiation of HAART in infected individuals as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms of primary HIV-1 infection did not prevent generation of latently infected, resting CD4(+) T cells carrying integrated HIV-1 DNA as well as infectious HIV-1 despite the successful control of plasma viremia shortly after institution of HAART. Furthermore, there was no correlation between either the duration of HAART at the time of study (range: 0.2-17 months) or the time of initiation of HAART after the onset of symptoms of primary HIV-1 infection (range: 0.3-4 months) and the frequencies of resting CD4(+) T cells carrying either integrated HIV-1 DNA or infectious virus. These results underscore the rapidity with which latent reservoirs are established in primary HIV-1 infection and indicate that it is unlikely that early treatment during primary infection can prevent establishment of a pool of latently infected, resting CD4(+) T cells as long as treatment is initiated after plasma viremia becomes evident.},

  Abstract                 = {Although it has been demonstrated that certain cytokines, particularly proinflammatory cytokines, can enhance ongoing viral replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-1-infected individuals, it is unclear what role these cytokines play in the induction of HIV-1 replication in latently infected, resting CD4(+) T cells. This study demonstrates that the in vitro combination of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha together with the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-2 are potent inducers of viral replication in highly purified, latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells derived from HIV-infected individuals who are antiretroviral therapy-naive as well as those who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Viral replication induced by this combination of cytokines was completely suppressed in the presence of HAART in vitro. Given that an array of cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-2, are copiously expressed in the microenvironment of the lymphoid tissues, which harbor the latent viral reservoirs, induction of HIV by this combination of cytokines may in part explain the commonly observed reappearance of detectable plasma viremia in HIV-infected individuals in whom HAART was discontinued. Moreover, since it is likely that these infected cells die upon activation of virus and that HAART prevents spread of virus to adjacent cells, the observation that this combination of cytokines can markedly induce viral replication in this reservoir may have important implications for the activation-mediated diminution of the latent reservoir of HIV in patients receiving HAART.},

Using resting CD4+ T-cell populations of extremely high purity and a novel assay that selectively and unambiguously detects integrated HIV-1, we show that resting CD4+ T cells harbouring integrated provirus are present in some infected individuals. However, these cells do not accumulate within the circulating pool of resting CD4+ T cells in the early stages of HIV-1 infection and do not accumulate even after prolonged periods in long-term survivors of HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that because of viral cytopathic effects and/or host effector mechanisms, productively infected CD4+ T cells do not generally survive for long enough to revert to a resting memory state in vivo.},

These activities may contribute to low-level viral replication in nonproliferating cells. Through the use of oligonucleotide microarrays and high-throughput Western blotting we demonstrate that one of these proteins, gp120, induces the expression of cytokines, chemokines, kinases, and transcription factors associated with antigen-specific T cell activation in the absence of cellular proliferation. Examination of transcriptional changes induced by gp120 in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived-macrophages reveals a broad and complex transcriptional program conducive to productive infection with HIV. Observations include the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells, components of the RNA polymerase II complex including TFII D, proteins localized to the plasma membrane, including several syntaxins, and members of the Rho protein family, including Cdc 42. These observations provide evidence that envelope-mediated signaling contributes to the productive infection of HIV in suboptimally activated T cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Reversal of proviral latency is being pursued as a curative strategy for HIV-1 infection. Recent clinical studies of in vivo administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat) show increases in unspliced cellular HIV-1 RNA levels in resting CD4(+) T cells. A critical unknown, however, is the proportion of latent proviruses that can be transcriptionally reactivated by SAHA or T-cell activation. In this study, we quantified the fraction of HIV-1 proviruses in resting CD4(+) T cells from patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy that were reactivated ex vivo with SAHA or antibodies to CD3/CD28. At concentrations of SAHA achieved clinically, only 0.079\% of proviruses in resting CD4(+) T cells were reactivated to produce virions, compared with 1.5\% of proviruses in cells treated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies after correcting for spontaneous virion production in the medium control. A significant positive correlation (ρ = 0.67, P < 0.001) was found between levels of virions in the supernatant and unspliced cellular HIV-1 RNA following anti-CD3/CD28 treatment, but not following SAHA treatment (ρ = 0.21, P = 0.99). These results reveal that the majority of HIV-1 proviruses are not reactivated by current therapeutic approaches and that more effective means of reversing proviral latency will likely be required to deplete HIV-1 reservoirs.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of approximately 24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs-specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to approximately 20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes.},

Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.},

Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, the West African AIDS retrovirus and LAV differ substantially in their envelope glycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognized by serum from a macaque with simian AIDS infected by the simian retrovirus termed STLV-IIImac, suggesting that the West African AIDS virus may be more closely related to this simian virus than to LAV. Hybridization experiments with LAV subgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to as LAV-II, is distantly related to LAV and distinct from STLV-IIImac.},

  Abstract                 = {A T cell clone (ACH-2) derived from T cells infected with HIV-1 was found to produce HIV-1 in response to stimulation with a monokine-enriched supernatant prepared by culturing human monocyte/macrophages with bacterial LPS (LPS-MO SN). Monokine induction of ACH-2 cells resulted in augmented virus production reflected by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity and in the synthesis of all major viral proteins. Examination of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that 10 to 15\% of uninduced cells constitutively expressed HIV proteins, whereas 100\% showed positive immunofluorescence in response to LPS-MO SN. This induction of virus by LPS-MO SN resulted in approximately a 100-fold increase of infectious virus production over uninduced ACH-2 cells. LPS alone could not induce HIV-1 expression, whereas LPS-MO SN resulted in the greatest virus expression. Cell separation studies confirmed the source of the inducing factor(s) to be cells bearing the mature monocyte/macrophage marker, Leu M3. Biochemical fractionation of the LPS-MO SN suggested that one or more factors, having apparent Mr of approximately 45 kDa, were involved in this induction. Absorption of the LPS-MO SN with immunoaffinity gels specific for human TNF-alpha was shown to completely remove the HIV inducing activity for the ACH-2 cell line.},

There was no evidence of an underlying immunosuppressive disease, and no history of homosexuality or intravenous drug abuse. The male:female ratio was 1.5. All patients had opportunistic infections. Five of them also had Kaposi's sarcoma. All patients tested had immunologic features of severe T-cell depression. The overall mortality was 42.5 percent.

Here, we have investigated the presence of such template-switching artifacts in cDNA databases, by scanning a collection of human splice sites (Information for the Coordinates of Exons, ICE database). We have confirmed several cases at the experimental level. Artifacts represent a significant portion of apparently spliced sequences using noncanonical splice signals but are rare in the context of the whole database. However, care should be taken in the annotation of alternative transcripts, especially when the RT used is poorly thermostable and when the putative intron is flanked by direct repeats, which are the substrate for template switching.},

However, at high mutation rates, the fittest organisms are not necessarily the fastest replicators but rather are those that show the greatest robustness against deleterious mutational effects, even at the cost of a low replication rate. This scenario, dubbed the "survival of the flattest", has so far only been shown to operate in digital organisms. We show that "survival of the flattest" can also occur in biological entities by analyzing the outcome of competition between two viroid species coinfecting the same plant. Under optimal growth conditions, a viroid species characterized by fast population growth and genetic homogeneity outcompeted a viroid species with slow population growth and a high degree of variation. In contrast, the slow-growth species was able to outcompete the fast species when the mutation rate was increased. These experimental results were supported by an in silico model of competing viroid quasispecies.},

The virus establishes lytic, latent and non-cytopathic productive infection in cells in culture. The complexity of virus-host cell interaction is reflected in the complex organization of the viral genome. In addition to the genes that encode the virion capsid and envelope proteins and the enzymes required for proviral synthesis and integration common to all retroviruses, HIV-1 is known to encode at least four additional proteins that regulate virus replication, the tat, art, sor and 3' orf proteins, as well as a protein of unknown function from the open reading frame called R. Close examination of the nucleic acid sequences of the genomes of multiple HIV isolates raised the possibility that the virus encodes a previously undetected additional protein. Here we report that HIV-1 encodes a ninth protein and that antibodies to this protein are detected in the sera of people infected with HIV-1. This protein distinguishes HIV-1 isolates from the other human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-2 and SIV) that do not have the capacity to encode a similar protein.},

  Abstract                 = {The barrier to curing HIV-1 is thought to reside primarily in CD4(+) T cells containing silent proviruses. To characterize these latently infected cells, we studied the integration profile of HIV-1 in viremic progressors, individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, and viremic controllers. Clonally expanded T cells represented the majority of all integrations and increased during therapy. However, none of the 75 expanded T cell clones assayed contained intact virus. In contrast, the cells bearing single integration events decreased in frequency over time on therapy, and the surviving cells were enriched for HIV-1 integration in silent regions of the genome. Finally, there was a strong preference for integration into, or in close proximity to, Alu repeats, which were also enriched in local hotspots for integration. The data indicate that dividing clonally expanded T cells contain defective proviruses and that the replication-competent reservoir is primarily found in CD4(+) T cells that remain relatively quiescent.},

Expressed Tat protein (aa 1-101) was proved to present basically a nuclear localisation, and to be fully functional to induce HIV LTR transactivation. Tat expression also resulted in protection from Tunicamycin-induced apoptosis as determined by DNA staining and TUNEL assays. We applied proteomics methods to investigate changes in differential protein expression in the transfected Jurkat-Tat cells. Protein identification was performed using 2-D DIGE followed by MS analysis. We identified the down-regulation of several cytoskeletal proteins such as actin, beta-tubulin, annexin II, as well as gelsolin, cofilin and the Rac/Rho-GDI complex. Down-expression of these proteins could be involved in the survival of long-term reservoirs of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells responsible for continuous viral production. In conclusion, in addition to its role in viral mRNA elongation, the proteomic approach has provided insight into the way that Tat modifies host cell gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that function to control gene expression and restrict viral replication in host cells. The production of miRNAs is believed to be dependent upon the DICER enzyme. Available evidence suggests that in T lymphocytes, HIV-1 can both suppress and co-opt the host's miRNA pathway for its own benefit. In this study, we examined the state of miRNA production in monocytes and macrophages as well as the consequences of viral infection upon the production of miRNA. Monocytes in general express low amounts of miRNA-related proteins, and DICER in particular could not be detected until after monocytes were differentiated into macrophages. In the case where HIV-1 was present prior to differentiation, the expression of DICER was suppressed. MicroRNA chip results for RNA isolated from transfected and treated cells indicated that a drop in miRNA production coincided with DICER protein suppression in macrophages. We found that the expression of DICER in monocytes is restricted by miR-106a, but HIV-1 suppressed DICER expression via the viral gene Vpr. Additionally, analysis of miRNA expression in monocytes and macrophages revealed evidence that some miRNAs can be processed by both DICER and PIWIL4. Results presented here have implications for both the pathology of viral infections in macrophages and the biogenesis of miRNAs. First, HIV-1 suppresses the expression and function of DICER in macrophages via a previously unknown mechanism. Second, the presence of miRNAs in monocytes lacking DICER indicates that some miRNAs can be generated by proteins other than DICER.},

Individual data on 13030 HIV-1-infected individuals from 15 countries were collated, checked, and analysed centrally. We calculated estimates of mortality and AIDS incidence rates and estimated the proportions of individuals surviving and developing AIDS at each year after seroconversion from the numbers of observed deaths or cases of AIDS and the corresponding person-years at risk. Analyses were adjusted for age at seroconversion, time since seroconversion, and other factors as appropriate.Mortality and AIDS incidence increased strongly with time since seroconversion and age at seroconversion. Median survival varied from 12.5 years (95\% CI 12.1-12.9) for those aged 15-24 years at seroconversion to 7.9 years (7.4-8.5) for those aged 45-54 years at seroconversion, whereas for development of AIDS the corresponding values were 11.0 years (10.7-11.7) and 7.7 years (7.1-8.6). There was no appreciable effect of exposure category on survival. For AIDS incidence, the exposure category effect that we noted was explained by the high incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in those infected through sex between men. We estimated that among people aged 25-29 years at seroconversion 90\% (89-91) and 60\% (57-62) survived to 5 years and 10 years, respectively, after seroconversion, whereas 13\% (12-15) and 46\% (44-49), respectively, developed AIDS (excluding Kaposi's sarcoma).Before widespread use of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (before 1996), time since seroconversion and age at seroconversion were the major determinants of survival and development of AIDS in Europe, North America, and Australia.},

Daily dosages in milligrams of zidovudine and didanosine, respectively, in the five combination groups were 150 and 90 mg, 300 and 334 mg, 600 and 334 mg, 300 and 500 mg, and 600 and 500 mg.CD4+ cell counts, HIV-1 RNA titers in plasma, and toxic effects.The combination regimens were associated with higher and more sustained increases in CD4+ cells than zidovudine alone, even after adjustment for initial CD4+ counts and previous zidovudine therapy (P < 0.001). The median increase in CD4+ cell counts was 166 cells/mm3 with combination therapy and 77 cells/mm3 with zidovudine alone (P = 0.001) and did not differ statistically among the five combination regimens. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA titers in plasma decreased in 15 (83\%) of 18 combination-therapy recipients compared with 2 of 7 zidovudine-alone recipients (P = 0.017). No pharmacokinetic interactions were seen between zidovudine and didanosine. Toxicity rates were low among all treatment groups. A greater decrease in hemoglobin levels was seen with the regimen using zidovudine alone (-8 g/L) compared with combination regimens using the same zidovudine dose (-1.5 g/L, P = 0.03).Combination therapy with zidovudine and didanosine produced larger and more sustained increases in CD4+ cell counts, more frequent decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA titers, and more stable hematologic status than zidovudine therapy alone. The effects of this combination on the progression of HIV disease merit further study, to provide information about clinical outcome, because this was a relatively small study based on surrogate markers of HIV-1 infection.},

  Abstract                 = {In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, combined treatment with several agents may increase the effectiveness of antiviral therapy. We studied the safety and efficacy of saquinavir, an HIV-protease inhibitor, given with one or two nucleoside antiretroviral agents, as compared with the safety and efficacy of a combination of two nucleosides alone.In this double-blind trial, patients with HIV infection were randomly assigned to receive either saquinavir (1800 mg per day) plus both zidovudine (600 mg per day) and zalcitabine (2.25 mg per day) or zidovudine plus either saquinavir or zalcitabine. The 302 patients enrolled had CD4+ counts of 50 to 300 cells per cubic millimeter and had previously received zidovudine for a median of 27 months. The study lasted 24 weeks, with an optional double-blind extension period of an additional 12 to 32 weeks.Ninety-six percent of the patients completed the 24-week study. In all three treatment groups, CD4+ cell counts rose at first and then fell gradually. The normalized area under the curve for the CD4+ count was greater with the three-drug combination than with either saquinavir and zidovudine (P=0.017) or zalcitabine and zidovudine (P<0.001). There were significantly greater reductions in plasma HIV with the three-drug combination than with the other regimens when peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were cultured for HIV and HIV RNA was assessed, and there were greater decreases in serum neopterin and beta2-microglobulin levels. There were no major differences in toxic effects among the three treatments.Treatment with saquinavir, zalcitabine, and zidovudine was well tolerated. This drug combination reduced HIV-1 replication, increased CD4+ cell counts, and decreased levels of activation markers in serum more than did treatment with zidovudine and either saquinavir or zalcitabine. Studies are warranted to evaluate whether the three-drug combination will reduce morbidity and mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Determining the fitness of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains is necessary for the development of population-based studies of resistance patterns. For this purpose, we have developed a reproducible, systematic assay to determine the competitive fitness of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants. To demonstrate the applicability of this assay, we tested the fitness of the five most common nevirapine-resistant mutants (103N, 106A, 181C, 188C, and 190A), with mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), singly and in combination (for a total of 31 variants) in a defined HIV-1 background. For these experiments, the 27 RT variants that produced viable virus were cocultured with wild-type virus without nevirapine. The ratios of the viral species were determined over time by utilization of a quantitative real-time RT-PCR-based assay. These experiments revealed that all of the viable variants were less fit than the wild type and demonstrated that the order of relative fitness of the single mutants tested was as follows: 103N > 181C > 190A > 188C > 106A. This order correlated with the commonality of these mutants as a result of nevirapine monotherapy. These investigations also revealed that, on average, the double mutants were less fit than the single mutants and the triple mutants were less fit than the double mutants. However, the fitness of the single and double mutants was often not predictive of the fitness of the derivative triple mutants, suggesting the presence of complex interactions between the closely aligned residues that confer nevirapine resistance. This complexity was also evident from the observation that all three of the replication-competent quadruple mutants were fitter than most of the triple mutants, and in some cases, even the double mutants. Our data suggest that, in many cases, viral fitness is the determining factor in the evolution of nevirapine-resistant mutants in vivo, that interactions between the residues that confer nevirapine resistance are complex, and that these interactions substantially affect reverse transcriptase structure and/or function.},

However, despite a strong CTL response directed against viral epitopes, untreated people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) develop AIDS. To resolve this enigma, we have examined the ability of CTLs to recognize and kill infected primary T lymphocytes. We found that CTLs inefficiently lysed primary cells infected with HIV-1 if the viral nef gene product was expressed. Resistance of infected cells to CTL killing correlated with nef-mediated downregulation of MHC class I and could be overcome by adding an excess of the relevant HIV-1 epitope as soluble peptide. Thus, Nef protected infected cells by reducing the epitope density on their surface. This effect of nef may allow evasion of CTL lysis by HIV-1-infected cells.},

This increase may be a result of dissemination of lung-derived HIV-1 isolates from sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and/or the systemic activation of the immune system in response to TB. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, blood and pleural fluid samples were obtained from HIV-1-infected patients with active pleural TB in Kampala, Uganda (CD4 cell counts of 34 to 705 cells/µl, HIV-1 plasma loads of 2,400 to 280,000 RNA copies/ml, and HIV-1 pleural loads of 7,600 to 4,500,000 RNA copies/ml). The C2-C3 coding region of HIV-1 env was PCR amplified from lysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and pleural fluid mononuclear cells and reverse transcriptase-PCR amplified from plasma and pleural fluid HIV-1 virions of eight HIV-1 patients with pleural TB. Phylogenetic and phenetic analyses revealed a compartmentalization of HIV-1 quasispecies between blood and pleural space in four of eight patients, with migration events between the compartments. There was a trend for a greater genetic heterogeneity in the pleural space, which may be the result of an M. tuberculosis-mediated increase in HIV-1 replication and/or selection pressure at the site of infection. Collectively, these findings suggest that HIV-1 quasispecies in the M. tuberculosis-infected pleural space may leak into the systemic circulation and lead to increased systemic HIV-1 heterogeneity during TB.},

By comparing the differences between spliceosomal proteins from many basal eukaryotic lineages, it is possible to infer properties of the splicing system in the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes, the eukaryotic ancestor. We begin with the hypothesis that, similar to intron length (that appears to have increased in multicellular eukaryotes), the spliceosome has increased in complexity throughout eukaryotic evolution. However, examination of the distribution of spliceosomal components indicates that not only was a spliceosome present in the eukaryotic ancestor but it also contained most of the key components found in today's eukaryotes. All the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) protein components are likely to have been present, as well as many splicing-related proteins. Both major and trans-splicing are likely to have been present, and the spliceosome had already formed links with other cellular processes such as transcription and capping. However, there is no evidence as yet to suggest that minor (U12-dependent) splicing was present in the eukaryotic ancestor. Although the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes appears to show much of the molecular complexity seen today, we do not, from this work, infer anything of the properties of the earlier "first eukaryote."},

It is still unclear, however, to what extent this is contributed by the dysregulation of the molecular mechanisms governing virus gene expression at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels. To address this issue, several quantitative virologic parameters (including provirus transcriptional activity and splicing pattern) were analyzed in individuals with nonprogressive HIV infection and compared with those of a matched group of progressor patients. Exact quantification was achieved by a competitive PCR procedure using a multicompetitor template. Nonprogressors were characterized by striking differences in the levels of viremia, provirus copy number, and overall levels of all viral mRNA classes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, the transcriptional activity of the proviral DNA in these patients was mainly engaged in the production of multiprocessed transcripts, with a pattern resembling the early phases of the experimental infection. Taken together, these results show that both viral load and provirus transcription pattern are remarkably different in infected individuals nonprogressing toward overt disease, and further support the notion that disease progression is accompanied by a change in the kinetics of HIV gene expression.},

Furthermore, in all but one case, the critical mutation rate is higher than the error threshold, a key parameter in quasispecies theory, which prevents its extrapolation to natural viral populations.From these results we conclude that digital organisms are useful tools for investigating evolutionary patterns and processes including some predictions from the quasispecies theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Maternal-infant transmission is the primary means by which young children become infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of zidovudine in reducing the risk of maternal-infant HIV transmission. HIV-infected pregnant women (14 to 34 weeks' gestation) with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts above 200 cells per cubic millimeter who had not received antiretroviral therapy during the current pregnancy were enrolled. The zidovudine regimen included antepartum zidovudine (100 mg orally five times daily), intrapartum zidovudine (2 mg per kilogram of body weight given intravenously over one hour, then 1 mg per kilogram per hour until delivery), and zidovudine for the newborn (2 mg per kilogram orally every six hours for six weeks). Infants with at least one positive HIV culture of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were classified as HIV-infected.From April 1991 through December 20, 1993, the cutoff date for the first interim analysis of efficacy, 477 pregnant women were enrolled; during the study period, 409 gave birth to 415 live-born infants. HIV-infection status was known for 363 births (180 in the zidovudine group and 183 in the placebo group). Thirteen infants in the zidovudine group and 40 in the placebo group were HIV-infected. The proportions infected at 18 months, as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, were 8.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 12.8 percent) in the zidovudine group and 25.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 18.4 to 32.5 percent) in the placebo group. This corresponds to a 67.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 40.7 to 82.1 percent) relative reduction in the risk of HIV transmission (Z = 4.03, P = 0.00006). Minimal short-term toxic effects were observed. The level of hemoglobin at birth in the infants in the zidovudine group was significantly lower than that in the infants in the placebo group. By 12 weeks of age, hemoglobin values in the two groups were similar.In pregnant women with mildly symptomatic HIV disease and no prior treatment with antiretroviral drugs during the pregnancy, a regimen consisting of zidovudine given ante partum and intra partum to the mother and to the newborn for six weeks reduced the risk of maternal-infant HIV transmission by approximately two thirds.},

Indeed, P-TEFb, a critical transcription cofactor for HIV, is released and then recruited to the viral promoter upon stimulation with SAHA. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is involved in the initiation of these events. Using flow cytometry-based single cell analysis of protein phosphorylation, we demonstrate that SAHA activates this pathway in several subpopulations of T cells, including memory T cells that are the major viral reservoir in peripheral blood. Importantly, SAHA activates HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals treated effectively with HAART. Thus SAHA, which is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, might be considered to accelerate the decay of the latent reservoir in HAART-treated infected humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) make up 8\% of the human genome. The HERV-K (HML-2) family is the most recent group of these viruses to have inserted into the genome, and we have detected the activation of HERV-K (HML-2) proviruses in the blood of patients with HIV-1 infection. We report that HIV-1 infection activates expression of a novel HERV-K (HML-2) provirus, termed K111, present in multiple copies in the centromeres of chromosomes throughout the human genome yet not annotated in the most recent human genome assembly. Infection with HIV-1 or stimulation with the HIV-1 Tat protein leads to the activation of K111 proviruses. K111 is present as a single copy in the genome of the chimpanzee, yet K111 is not found in the genomes of other primates. Remarkably, K111 proviruses appear in the genomes of the extinct Neanderthal and Denisovan, while modern humans have at least 100 K111 proviruses spread across the centromeres of 15 chromosomes. Our studies suggest that the progenitor K111 integrated before the Homo-Pan divergence and expanded in copy number during the evolution of hominins, perhaps by recombination. The expansion of K111 provides sequence evidence suggesting that recombination between the centromeres of various chromosomes took place during the evolution of humans. K111 proviruses show significant sequence variations in each individual centromere, which may serve as markers in future efforts to annotate human centromere sequences. Further, this work is an example of the potential to discover previously unknown genomic sequences through the analysis of nucleic acids found in the blood of patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Approximately 8\% of the human genome sequence is composed by human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), most of which are defective. HERV-K(HML-2) is the youngest and most active family and has maintained some proviruses with intact open reading frames (ORFs) that code for viral proteins that may assemble into viral particles. Many HERV-K(HML-2) sequences are polymorphic in humans (present in some individuals but not in others) and probably many others may be unfixed (not inserted permanently in a specific chromosomal location of the human genome). In the present study HIV-1 and HCV-1-positive plasma samples were screened for the presence of HERV-K(HML-2) RNA in an RT-PCR using HERV-K pol specific primers. HERV-K(HML-2) viral RNA sequences were found almost universally in HIV-1(+) plasma samples (95.33\%) but were rarely detected in HCV-1 patients (5.2\%) or control subjects (7.69\%). Other HERV-K(HML-2) viral segments of the RNA genome including gag, prt, and both env regions, surface (su), and transmembrane (tm) were amplified from HERV-K pol-positive plasma of HIV-1 patients. Type 1 and type 2 HERV-K(HML- 2) viral RNA genomes were found to coexist in the same plasma of HIV-1 patients. These results suggest the HERV-K(HML-2) viral particles are induced in HIV-1-infected individuals.},

The expression of HERV-K was synergistically increased in HIV-1-infected PBMCs after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. Furthermore, the expression of HERV-K in PBMCs, and particularly in CD4(+) T cells, was higher in HIV-1 patients compared to control subjects.

To make cDNA libraries, we exploited the 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate at the end of RNA fragments produced by RNase L and other metal-ion-independent endoribonucleases. We optimized and validated 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing methods using viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase L, viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase A and RNA from uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Using these methods, we identified (i) discrete regions of hepatitis C virus and poliovirus RNA genomes that were profoundly susceptible to RNase L and other single-strand specific endoribonucleases, (ii) RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites within ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and (iii) 2', 3'-cyclic phosphates at the ends of 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA.

  Abstract                 = {A single cardiac troponin T gene generates two mRNA products by developmentally regulated alternate splicing. Nucleotide sequence of the entire 18 exon gene and both representative cDNAs demonstrate that the two mRNAs differ by the presence or absence of a single internal coding exon. Both mRNA products appear to be generated from a single primary transcript; however, one mRNA splice product predominates in early embryonic cardiac muscle while the other vastly predominates in adult cardiac muscle. The corresponding embryonic and adult cardiac troponin T proteins differ by the inclusion or exclusion, respectively, of an internal, highly acidic 10 amino acids near the amino terminus. Unusual features of the variable peptide region and its restriction to embryonic stages suggest that it might play a specialized role during sarcomere assembly in embryonic striated muscle. In addition to developmental regulation of RNA processing, the cardiac troponin T gene also demonstrates complex tissue-specific expression. We have previously shown that this single cardiac troponin gene is regulated according to two different and tissue-specific regulatory programs. Here we demonstrate that a single promoter is utilized for both expression patterns. The cardiac troponin T gene also has several interesting structural features including a pseudoexon and an exon only six nucleotides in length. The size of this exon establishes a new lower limit for the number of nucleotides that can be recognized as an exonic sequence.},

  Abstract                 = {CD4(+) T-cell depletion is a characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In this study, modulation of mRNA expression of 6800 genes was monitored simultaneously at eight time points in a CD4(+) T-cell line (CEM-GFP) during HIV infection. The responses to infection included: (1) >30\% decrease at 72 h after infection in overall host-cell production of monitored mRNA synthesis, with the replacement of host-cell mRNA by viral mRNA, (2) suppression of the expression of selected mitochondrial and DNA repair gene transcripts, (3) increased expression of the proapoptotic gene and its gene p53-induced product Bax, and (4) activation of caspases 2, 3, and 9. The intense HIV-1 transcription resulted in the repression of much cellular RNA expression and was associated with the induction of apoptosis of infected cells but not bystander cells. This choreographed host gene response indicated that the subversion of the cell transcriptional machinery for the purpose of HIV-1 replication is akin to genotoxic stress and represents a major factor leading to HIV-induced apoptosis.},

In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on approximately 30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3' cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription.},

  Abstract                 = {The CD4 protein is required for the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into target cells. Upon expression of the viral genome, three HIV-1 gene products participate in the removal of the primary viral receptor from the cell surface. To investigate the role of surface-CD4 in HIV replication, we have created a set of Jurkat cell lines which constitutively express surface levels of CD4 comparable to those found in peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes. Expression of low levels of CD4 on the surface of producer cells exerted an inhibitory effect on the infectivity of HIV-1 particles, whereas no differences in the amount of cell-free p24 antigen were observed. Higher levels of cell surface CD4 exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on infectivity, and also affected the release of free virus in experiments where the viral genomes were delivered by electrotransfection. The CD4-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity was not observed in experiments where the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was used to pseudotype viruses, suggesting that an interaction between CD4 and gp120 is required for interference. In contrast, inhibition of particle release by high levels of cell-surface CD4 was not overcome by pseudotyping HIV-1 with foreign envelope proteins. Protein analysis of viral particles released from HIV-infected Jurkat-T cells revealed a CD4-dependent reduction in the incorporation of gp120. These results demonstrate that physiological levels of cell-surface CD4 interfere with HIV-1 replication in T cells by a mechanism that inhibits envelope incorporation into viral membranes, and therefore provide an explanation for the need to down-modulate the viral receptor in infected cells. Our findings have important implications for the spread of HIV in vivo and suggest that the CD4 down-modulation function may be an alternative target for therapeutic intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {Several distinct families of endogenous retrovirus-like elements (ERVs) exist in the genomes of primates. Despite the important evolutionary consequences that carrying these intragenomic parasites may have for their hosts, our knowledge about their evolution is still scarce. A matter of particular interest is whether evolution of ERVs occurs via a master lineage or through several lineages coexisting over long periods of time. In this work, the paleogenomic approach has been applied to the study of the evolution of ERV9, one of the human endogenous retrovirus families mobilized during primate evolution. By searching the GenBank database with the first 676 bp of the ERV9 long terminal repeat, we identified 156 different element insertions into the human genome. These elements were grouped into 14 subfamilies based on several characteristic nucleotide differences. The age of each subfamily was roughly estimated based on the average sequence divergence of its members from the subfamily consensus sequence. Determination of the sequential order of diagnostic substitutions led to the identification of four distinct lineages, which retained their capacity of transposition over extended periods of evolution. Strong evidence for mosaic evolution of some of these lineages is presented. Taken altogether, the available data indicate that the possibility of ERV9 still being active in the human lineage can not be discarded.},

  Abstract                 = {Enigmatic mechanisms restore the resting state in activated lymphocytes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, rarely allowing persistent nonproductive infection. We detail a mechanism whereby cellular factors could establish virological latency. The transcription factors YY1 and LSF cooperate in repression of transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). LSF recruits YY1 to the LTR via the zinc fingers of YY1. The first two zinc fingers were observed to be sufficient for this interaction in vitro. A mutant of LSF incapable of binding DNA blocked repression. Like other transcriptional repressors, YY1 can function via recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC). We find that HDAC1 copurifies with the LTR-binding YY1-LSF repressor complex, the domain of YY1 that interacts with HDAC1 is required to repress the HIV-1 promoter, expression of HDAC1 augments repression of the LTR by YY1, and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A blocks repression mediated by YY1. This novel link between HDAC recruitment and inhibition of HIV-1 expression by YY1 and LSF, in the natural context of a viral promoter integrated into chromosomal DNA, is the first demonstration of a molecular mechanism of repression of HIV-1. YY1 and LSF may establish transcriptional and virological latency of HIV, a state that has recently been recognized in vivo and has significant implications for the long-term treatment of AIDS.},

HIV-2 isolates showed a similar sensitivity to the drugs compared to HIV-1 isolates. Both the relative and the absolute potencies of the three drugs were similar for inhibition of HIV-1 or HIV-2 replication. The effect of combinations of the antiviral drugs was also studied. The combinations of AZT plus FLT, AZT plus ddI, and FLT plus ddI showed synergistic inhibition of three primary HIV-2 isolates, similar to that previously shown for primary HIV-1 isolates. These results indicate that primary isolates of HIV-2 from untreated persons show a level of sensitivity to antiviral nucleoside analogs similar to that shown by HIV-1 isolates, and are also synergistically inhibited by drug combinations shown to be synergistic against HIV-1. Therapeutic regimes with nucleoside analogs used clinically against HIV-1 infection may therefore also be similarly useful against infection with HIV-2.},

  Abstract                 = {The majority of mammalian pre-mRNAs contains multiple introns that are excised prior to export and translation. After intron excision, ligated exon intermediates participate in subsequent intron excisions. However, exon ligation generates an exon of increased size, a feature of pre-mRNA splicing that can interfere with downstream splicing events. These considerations raise the question of whether unique mechanisms exist that permit efficient removal of introns neighboring ligated exons. Kinetic analyses of multiple intron-containing pre-mRNAs revealed that splicing is more efficient following an initial intron removal event, suggesting that either the recruitment of the exon junction complex (EJC) to ligated exons increases the efficiency of multiple intron excisions or that the initial definition of splice sites is sufficient to permit efficient splicing of introns neighboring ligated exons. Knockdown experiments show that the deposition of the EJC does not affect subsequent splicing kinetics. Instead, spliceosomal components that are not involved in the initial splicing event remain associated with the pre-mRNA to ensure efficient removal of neighboring introns. Thus, ligated exons do not require redefinition, providing an additional kinetic advantage for exon defined splice sites.},

Furthermore, the disease associated with the equine lentivirus poses a significant challenge to veterinary medicine around the world. As with all lentiviruses, EIAV has been shown to have a high propensity for genomic sequence and antigenic variation, especially in its envelope (Env) proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated Env variation to be a major determinant of vaccine efficacy, emphasizing the importance of defining natural variation among field isolates of EIAV. To date, however, published EIAV sequences have been reported only for cell-adapted strains of virus, predominantly derived from a single primary virus isolate, EIAVWyoming (EIAVWY).We present here the first characterization of the Env protein of a natural primary isolate from Pennsylvania (EIAVPA) since the widely utilized and referenced EIAVWY strain. The data demonstrated that the level of EIAVPA Env amino acid sequence variation, approximately 40\% as compared to EIAVWY, is much greater than current perceptions or published reports of natural EIAV variation between field isolates. This variation did not appear to give rise to changes in the predicted secondary structure of the proteins. While the EIAVPA Env was serologically cross reactive with the Env proteins of the cell-adapted reference strain, EIAVPV (derivative of EIAVWY), the two variant Envs were shown to lack any cross neutralization by immune serum from horses infected with the respective virus strains.Taking into account the significance of serum neutralization to universal vaccine efficacy, these findings are crucial considerations towards successful EIAV vaccine development and the potential inclusion of field isolate Envs in vaccine candidates.},

  Abstract                 = {Repetitive elements comprise at least 55\% of the human genome with more recent estimates as high as two-thirds. Most of these elements are retrotransposons, DNA sequences that can insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations by a "copy and paste" mechanism. These mobile genetic elements play important roles in shaping genomes during evolution, and have been implicated in the etiology of many human diseases. Despite their abundance and diversity, few studies investigated the regulation of endogenous retrotransposons at the genome-wide scale, primarily because of the technical difficulties of uniquely mapping high-throughput sequencing reads to repetitive DNA.Here we develop a new computational method called RepEnrich to study genome-wide transcriptional regulation of repetitive elements. We show that many of the Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons in humans are transcriptionally active in a cell line-specific manner. Cancer cell lines display increased RNA Polymerase II binding to retrotransposons than cell lines derived from normal tissue. Consistent with increased transcriptional activity of retrotransposons in cancer cells we found significantly higher levels of L1 retrotransposon RNA expression in prostate tumors compared to normal-matched controls.Our results support increased transcription of retrotransposons in transformed cells, which may explain the somatic retrotransposition events recently reported in several types of cancers.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed coexpression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 glycoprotein precursor, gp160, and its cellular receptor CD4 in HeLa cells to determine whether the two molecules can interact prior to transport to the cell surface. Results of studies employing coprecipitation, analysis of oligosaccharide processing, and immunocytochemistry showed that newly synthesized CD4 and gp160 form a complex prior to transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). CD4 expressed by itself was transported efficiently from the ER to the cell surface, but the complex of CD4 and gp160 was retained in the ER. This retention of CD4 within the ER is probably a consequence of the very inefficient transport of gp160 itself (R. L. Willey, J. S. Bonifacino, B. J. Potts, M. A. Martin, and R. D. Klausner, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:9580-9584, 1988). Retention of CD4 in the ER by gp160 may partially explain the down regulation of CD4 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected T cells. Inhibition of CD4 transport appears to be a consequence of the interaction of two membrane-bound molecules, because a complex of CD4 and gp120 (the soluble extracellular domain of gp160) was transported rapidly and efficiently from the ER.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA viruses evolve rapidly. One source of this ability to rapidly change is the apparently high mutation frequency in RNA virus populations. A high mutation frequency is a central tenet of the quasispecies theory. A corollary of the quasispecies theory postulates that, given their high mutation frequency, animal RNA viruses may be susceptible to error catastrophe, where they undergo a sharp drop in viability after a modest increase in mutation frequency. We recently showed that the important broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin (currently used to treat hepatitis C virus infections, among others) is an RNA virus mutagen, and we proposed that ribavirin's antiviral effect is by forcing RNA viruses into error catastrophe. However, a direct demonstration of error catastrophe has not been made for ribavirin or any RNA virus mutagen. Here we describe a direct demonstration of error catastrophe by using ribavirin as the mutagen and poliovirus as a model RNA virus. We demonstrate that ribavirin's antiviral activity is exerted directly through lethal mutagenesis of the viral genetic material. A 99.3\% loss in viral genome infectivity is observed after a single round of virus infection in ribavirin concentrations sufficient to cause a 9.7-fold increase in mutagenesis. Compiling data on both the mutation levels and the specific infectivities of poliovirus genomes produced in the presence of ribavirin, we have constructed a graph of error catastrophe showing that normal poliovirus indeed exists at the edge of viability. These data suggest that RNA virus mutagens may represent a promising new class of antiviral drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {Whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconverters have been presenting with progressively lower CD4 cell counts over the course of the HIV epidemic is controversial. Additional data on whether HIV might have become more virulent on a population level (measured by post-seroconversion CD4 cell counts) may provide important insights regarding HIV pathogenesis.To determine whether post-seroconversion CD4 cell counts have changed over time, we evaluated 2174 HIV seroconverters as part of a large cohort study during the period 1985-2007. Participants were documented antiretroviral-naive HIV seroconverters who had a CD4 cell count measured within 6 months after receiving a diagnosis of HIV infection. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess trends in initial CD4 cell counts.The mean initial CD4 cell count decreased during the study period from 632 cells/mm(3) in 1985-1990 to 553 cells/mm(3) in 1991-1995, 493 cells/mm(3) in 1996-2001, and 514 cells/mm(3) in 2002-2007. During those periods, the percentages of seroconverters with an initial CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm(3) were 12\%, 21\%, 26\%, and 25\%, respectively. In the multiple linear model, the mean decrease in CD4 cell count from 1985-1990 was 65 cells/mm(3) in 1991-1995 (P < .001)), 107 cells/mm(3) in 1996-2001 (P < .001), and 102 cells/mm(3) in 2002-2007 (P < .001). Similar trends occurred with regard to CD4 cell percentage and total lymphocyte count. Similar decreases in initial CD4 cell counts were observed among African American and white persons during the epidemic.A significant decrease in initial CD4 cell counts among HIV seroconverters in the United States has occurred during the HIV epidemic. These data provide an important clinical correlate to suggestions that HIV may have adapted to the host, resulting in a more virulent infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Messenger RNAs containing premature stop codons are generally targeted for degradation through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This mechanism degrades aberrant transcripts derived from mutant genes containing nonsense or frameshift mutations. Wild-type genes also give rise to transcripts targeted by NMD. For example, some wild-type genes give rise to alternatively spliced transcripts that are targeted for decay by NMD. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the ribosomal protein (rp) L12 gene generates a nonsense codon-bearing alternatively spliced transcript that is induced in an autoregulatory manner by the rpL12 protein. By pharmacologically blocking the NMD pathway, we identified alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts derived from the human rpL3 and rpL12 genes that are natural targets of NMD. The deduced protein sequence of these alternatively spliced transcripts suggests that they are unlikely to encode functional ribosomal proteins. Overexpression of rpL3 increased the level of the alternatively spliced rpL3 mRNA and decreased the normally expressed rpL3. This indicates that rpL3 regulates its own production by a negative feedback loop and suggests the possibility that NMD participates in this regulatory loop by degrading the non-functional alternatively spliced transcript.},

In the absence of the trans-activating viral gene product, tat-III, IL-2 transcripts specific for the HIV LTR were present in low abundance in transfected cells and showed a low translational efficiency, when compared with IL-2 mRNAs transcribed from other viral promoters. Coexpression of tat-III resulted in a marked increase in the steady state level of IL-2 mRNAs transcribed from the HIV LTR, and these mRNAs also demonstrated a specific enhancement of their translational efficiency. These results suggest a bimodal mechanism of action for tat-III in the trans-activation of HIV-specific gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {To date, the use of traditional nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for detection of HIV-1 DNA or RNA has been restricted to laboratory settings due to time, equipment, and technical expertise requirements. The availability of a rapid NAAT with applicability for resource-limited or point-of-care (POC) settings would fill a great need in HIV diagnostics, allowing for timely diagnosis or confirmation of infection status, as well as facilitating the diagnosis of acute infection, screening and evaluation of infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Isothermal amplification methods, such as reverse-transcription, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), exhibit characteristics that are ideal for POC settings, since they are typically quicker, easier to perform, and allow for integration into low-tech, portable heating devices.In this study, we evaluated the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay using portable, non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heating devices that generate heat from the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water. The NINA heating devices exhibited stable temperatures throughout the amplification reaction and consistent amplification results between three separate devices and a thermalcycler. The performance of the NINA heaters was validated using whole blood specimens from HIV-1 infected patients.The RT-LAMP isothermal amplification method used in conjunction with a chemical heating device provides a portable, rapid and robust NAAT platform that has the potential to facilitate HIV-1 testing in resource-limited settings and POC.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV diagnosis at the point-of-care or in resource-limited settings poses considerable challenges due to time and cost limitations. Currently, nucleic acid-based tests are the only reliable method for diagnosing recent infections during the window period post-infection and pre-seroconversion, but these tests are only suitable for well-equipped laboratory settings. The reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology exhibits characteristics that are ideal for the development of a rapid, cost-effective nucleic acid-based test for detection of HIV DNA and RNA. In this study, a sequence-specific detection method was developed for immediate, naked-eye visualization of RT-LAMP products with high sensitivity and specificity. The rapid detection method was incorporated into the HIV-1-specific RT-LAMP assay and validated using minute volumes of whole blood from HIV-1-infected individuals. Together with the minimal sample preparation time and one-step, isothermal amplification reaction, the sequence-specific detection method adds to the overall versatility of the RT-LAMP assay and enhances the applicability for use at point-of-care or resource-limited sites.},

Amplification from lab-adapted HIV-1 DNA and RNA was detected as early as 30 min, with maximum sensitivity of 10 and 100 copies per reaction, respectively, reached at 60 min. Comparable sensitivity was observed with extracted nucleic acid from plasma and blood samples of HIV-1-infected individuals. Furthermore, the RT-LAMP procedure was modified for the direct detection of HIV-1 nucleic acid in plasma and blood samples, eliminating the need for an additional nucleic acid extraction step and reducing the overall procedure time to approximately 90 min.},

  Abstract                 = {Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by opportunistic infections and by 'opportunistic neoplasms' (for example, Kaposi's sarcoma). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is epidemiologically associated with AIDS, especially in male homosexuals. A subset of T lymphocytes positive for the CD4 antigen (also termed T4 antigen), is depleted in AIDS and PGL patients. A retrovirus found in T-cell cultures from these patients is strongly implicated in the aetiology of AIDS because of the high frequency of isolation and the prevalence of specific antibodies in the patients. Here we have detected cell-surface receptors for the AIDS retrovirus (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD4+ cells with HTLV-III or LAV-1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD4. In contrast, receptors for HTLV-I and HTLV-II were not restricted to CD4+ cells, were not blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies; cells productively infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II expressed surface CD4. Hence, we conclude that the CD4 antigen is an essential and specific component of the receptor for the causative agent of AIDS.},

Rev has been postulated to exert control within the nucleus at the level of messenger RNA processing. The availability of Rev in the nucleus serves to increase the proportion of unspliced and singly spliced mRNA species relative to fully spliced mRNA molecules, resulting in an increased synthesis of viral structural proteins. A highly conserved cis-acting sequence termed the Rev-responsive element (RRE) has been identified in the envelope gene (env) of the viral transcript that seems to control mRNA processing in a Rev-dependent manner. Genetic studies have identified rev gene mutants with dominant phenotypes, supporting the hypothesis that Rev interacts directly with the RRE. Here we demonstrate that Rev protein, purified from Escherichia coli, binds in a sequence-specific manner to the RRE element in vitro.},

  Abstract                 = {The nucleocapsid (NC) protein of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 (NCp7) is responsible for packaging the viral RNA by recognizing a packaging site (PSI) on the viral RNA genome. NCp7 is a molecule of 55 amino acids containing two zinc fingers, with only the first one being highly conserved among retroviruses. The first zinc finger is flanked by two basic amino acid clusters. Here we demonstrate that chemically synthesized NCp7 specifically binds to viral RNA containing the PSI using competitive filter binding assays. Deletion of the PSI from the RNA abrogates this effect. The 35 N-terminal amino acids of NCp7, comprising the first zinc finger, are sufficient for specific RNA binding. Chemically synthesized mutants of the first zinc finger demonstrate that the amino acid residues C-C-C/H-C/H are required for specific RNA binding and zinc coordination. Amino acid residues F16 and T24, but not K20, E21 and G22, located within this zinc finger, are essential for specific RNA binding as well. The second zinc finger cannot replace the first one. Furthermore, mutations in the basic amino acid residues flanking the first zinc finger demonstrate that R3, 7, 10, 29 and 32 but not K11, 14, 33 and 34 are also essential for specific binding. Specific binding to viral RNA is also observed with recombinant NCp15 and Pr55Gag. The results demonstrate for the first time specific interaction of a retroviral NC protein with its PSI RNA in vitro.},

Participants either had symptoms of HIV disease (if AIDS, with a CD4 cell count of > 50 x 10(6)/L) or a CD4 count of less than 350 x 10(6)/L; 2124 had not had zidovudine before (Delta 1) and 1083 had for at least 3 months (Delta 2).Over a median follow-up of 30 months, 699 participants died, and 936 of the 2765 without AIDS at entry developed AIDS or died. In participants who had not had AZT before, both combination regimens had substantial benefits in terms of survival (regardless of disease stage at entry); a relative reduction in mortality of 42\%, compared to AZT alone (95\% Cl 25\% to 55\%), for AZT plus ddl and of 32\% (95\% Cl 22\% to 47\%) for AZT plus ddC. In participants who had had AZT before, the addition of ddl improved survival (p = 0.05; relative reduction 23\% [95\% Cl 0\% to 41\%]) but there was no direct evidence of benefit from the addition of ddC (p = 0.47; relative reduction 9\% [95\% Cl--17\% to 29\%]). The overall difference in survival between the treatment groups was significant (p < 0.0001; a relative reduction in mortality, compared to AZT alone, of 33\% (95\% Cl 20\% to 44\%) for AZT plus ddl and 21\% (95\% Cl 6\% to 34\%) for AZT plus ddC). Benefit in terms of disease progression was seen mainly in participants not previously treated with AZT and overall. There was no unexpected toxicity from the combination treatments.Initiation of treatment with combinations of AZT plus ddl or ddC prolongs life and delays disease progression compared with AZT alone. The addition of ddl to participants already treated with AZT also improves survival, although the benefit appears less.},

  Abstract                 = {It is generally acknowledged that the Tat protein has a pivotal role in HIV-1 replication because it stimulates transcription from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter by binding to the TAR hairpin in the nascent RNA transcript. However, a multitude of additional Tat functions have been suggested. The importance of these functions is difficult to assess in replication studies with Tat-mutated HIV-1 variants because of the dominant negative effect on viral gene expression. We therefore used an HIV-1 construct that does not depend on the Tat-TAR interaction for transcription to reevaluate whether or not Tat has a second essential function in HIV-1 replication. This HIV-rtTA variant uses the incorporated Tet-On gene expression system for activation of transcription and replicates efficiently upon complete TAR deletion. Here we demonstrated that Tat inactivation does nevertheless severely inhibit replication. Upon long-term culturing, the Tat-minus HIV-rtTA variant acquired mutations in the U3 region that improved promoter activity and reestablished replication. We showed that in the absence of a functional TAR, Tat remains important for viral transcription via Sp1 sequence elements in the U3 promoter region. Substitution of these U3 sequences with nonrelated promoter elements created a virus that replicates efficiently without Tat in SupT1 T cells. These results indicate that Tat has a versatile role in transcription via TAR and U3 elements. The results also imply that Tat has no other essential function in viral replication in cultured T cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying the immunologic and virologic consequences of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients is of major importance in developing long-term treatment strategies for patients with HIV-1 infection. We designed a trial to characterize these parameters after interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients who had maintained prolonged viral suppression on antiretroviral drugs. Eighteen patients with CD4(+) T cell counts >/= 350 cells/microliter and viral load below the limits of detection for >/=1 year while on HAART were enrolled prospectively in a trial in which HAART was discontinued. Twelve of these patients had received prior IL-2 therapy and had low frequencies of resting, latently infected CD4 cells. Viral load relapse to >50 copies/ml occurred in all 18 patients independent of prior IL-2 treatment, beginning most commonly during weeks 2-3 after cessation of HAART. The mean relapse rate constant was 0.45 (0.20 log(10) copies) day(-1), which was very similar to the mean viral clearance rate constant after drug resumption of 0.35 (0.15 log(10) copies) day(-1) (P = 0.28). One patient experienced a relapse delay to week 7. All patients except one experienced a relapse burden to >5,000 RNA copies/ml. Ex vivo labeling with BrdUrd showed that CD4 and CD8 cell turnover increased after withdrawal of HAART and correlated with viral load whereas lymphocyte turnover decreased after reinitiation of drug treatment. Virologic relapse occurs rapidly in patients who discontinue suppressive drug therapy, even in patients with a markedly diminished pool of resting, latently infected CD4(+) T cells.},

These defects can be fully complemented in cell lines that constitutively express the tat-III gene product. We conclude that the tat-III gene product is required for efficient replication of HTLV-III in T4+ cells, and for that reason is important for the cytopathic effects of virus infection.

  Abstract                 = {It has recently been estimated that a single HIV-1 infected cell produces between and more than viral particles over its life span. Since body-wide estimates of the ratio of free virus to productively infected cells are smaller than and much smaller than , individual virions must be cleared rapidly. This seems difficult to reconcile with the fact that most of the total body virus is trapped on follicular dendritic cells where it can survive for many months. It has also been difficult to reconcile the vast difference in the rates at which the virus is cleared from the blood in rhesus macaques and in chronically infected patients. Here we attempt to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations by considering the virion clearance rate in various organs and the virion exchange rates between them. The main results are that the per capita clearance rate of free virus in lymphoid tissue should be fast, the virion exchange rate between lymphoid tissue and the blood should be slow, and the comparatively slow previous estimates for the virion clearance rate from the blood correspond to the rate of virion efflux from the blood to other organs where the virus is ultimately cleared.},

Serum beta 2-microglobulin levels and CD4+ cell counts exhibited similar responses. HIV-1 isolates obtained from 2 patients revealed 40- and 1000-fold reductions in nevirapine sensitivity after 8 weeks.

  Abstract                 = {Expression profiling holds great promise for rapid host genome functional analysis. It is plausible that host expression profiling in an infection could serve as a universal phenotype in virally infected cells. Here, we describe the effect of one of the most critical viral activators, Tat, in HIV-1 infected and Tat expressing cells. We utilized microarray analysis from uninfected, latently HIV-1 infected cells, as well as cells that express Tat, to decipher some of the cellular changes associated with this viral activator.Utilizing uninfected, HIV-1 latently infected cells, and Tat expressing cells, we observed that most of the cellular host genes in Tat expressing cells were down-regulated. The down-regulation in Tat expressing cells is most apparent on cellular receptors that have intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and signal transduction members that mediate RTK function, including Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. Co-activators of transcription, such as p300/CBP and SRC-1, which mediate gene expression related to hormone receptor genes, were also found to be down-regulated. Down-regulation of receptors may allow latent HIV-1 infected cells to either hide from the immune system or avoid extracellular differentiation signals. Some of the genes that were up-regulated included co-receptors for HIV-1 entry, translation machinery, and cell cycle regulatory proteins.We have demonstrated, through a microarray approach, that HIV-1 Tat is able to regulate many cellular genes that are involved in cell signaling, translation and ultimately control the host proliferative and differentiation signals.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) favors integration in active genes of host chromatin. It is believed that transcriptional interference of the viral promoter over the endogenous gene or vice versa might occur with implications in HIV-1 post-integrative transcriptional latency.In this work a cell line has been transduced with a HIV-based vector and selected for Tat-inducible expression. These cells were found to carry a single silent integration in sense orientation within the second intron of the HMBOX1 gene. The HIV-1 Tat transactivator induced the viral LTR and repressed HMBOX1 expression independently of vector integration. Instead, single-cell quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that allele-specific transcription of HMBOX1 carrying the integrated provirus was not affected by the transactivation of the viral LTR in cis.A major observation of the work is that the HIV-1 genome has inserted in genes that are also repressed by Tat and this could be an advantage for the virus during transcriptional reactivation. In addition, it has also been observed that transcription of the provirus and of the endogenous gene in which it is integrated may coexist at the same time in the same genomic location.},

Incorporation of Vpr in the virion was reported to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of the Pr55(Gag) polyprotein precursor, which includes NCp7, a protein involved in the genomic RNA encapsidation and p6, a protein required for particle budding. To precisely define the Gag and Vpr sequences involved in this protein-protein interaction, NCp7, p6, and Vpr as well as a series of derived peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Binding assays were carried out by Far Western experiments and by competition studies using (52-96)Vpr immobilized onto agarose beads. The results show that interaction between NCp7 and Vpr occurs in vitro by a recognition mechanism requiring the zinc fingers of NCp7 and the last 16 amino acids of Vpr. Moreover, NCp10, the equivalent of NCp7 in Moloney murine leukemia virus but not polysine inhibits Vpr-NCp7 complexation. Interestingly enough, Vpr was found to interact with Gag, NCp15, and NCp7 but not with mature p6 in vitro. In vivo mutations in NCp7 zinc fingers in an HIV-1 molecular clone led to viruses with important defects in Vpr encapsidation. Together, these results suggest that NCp7 cooperates with p6 to induce Vpr encapsidation in HIV-1 mature particles. The NCp7-Vpr complex could also be important for interaction of Vpr with cellular proteins involved in cell division.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 M originated from SIVcpz endemic in chimpanzees from southeast Cameroon or neighboring areas, and it started to spread in the early 20th century. Here we examine the factors that may have contributed to simian-to-human transmission, local transmission between humans, and export to a city. The region had intense ape hunting, social disruption, commercial sex work, STDs, and traffic to/from Kinshasa in the period 1899-1923. Injection treatments increased sharply around 1930; however, their frequency among local patients was far lower than among modern groups experiencing parenteral HIV-1 outbreaks. Recent molecular datings of HIV-1 M fit better the period of maximal resource exploitation and trade links than the period of high injection intensity. We conclude that although local parenteral outbreaks might have occurred, these are unlikely to have caused massive transmission. World War I led to additional, and hitherto unrecognized, risks of HIV-1 emergence. We propose an Enhanced Heterosexual Transmission Hypothesis for the origin of HIV-1 M, featuring at the time and place of its origin a coincidence of favorable co-factors (ape hunting, social disruption, STDs, and mobility) for both cross-species transmission and heterosexual spread. Our hypothesis does not exclude a role for parenteral transmission in the initial viral adaptation.},

  Abstract                 = {The processes that permitted a few SIV strains to emerge epidemically as HIV groups remain elusive. Paradigmatic theories propose factors that may have facilitated adaptation to the human host (e.g., unsafe injections), none of which provide a coherent explanation for the timing, geographical origin, and scarcity of epidemic HIV strains. Our updated molecular clock analyses established relatively narrow time intervals (roughly 1880-1940) for major SIV transfers to humans. Factors that could favor HIV emergence in this time frame may have been genital ulcer disease (GUD), resulting in high HIV-1 transmissibility (4-43\%), largely exceeding parenteral transmissibility; lack of male circumcision increasing male HIV infection risk; and gender-skewed city growth increasing sexual promiscuity. We surveyed colonial medical literature reporting incidences of GUD for the relevant regions, concentrating on cities, suffering less reporting biases than rural areas. Coinciding in time with the origin of the major HIV groups, colonial cities showed intense GUD outbreaks with incidences 1.5-2.5 orders of magnitude higher than in mid 20(th) century. We surveyed ethnographic literature, and concluded that male circumcision frequencies were lower in early 20(th) century than nowadays, with low rates correlating spatially with the emergence of HIV groups. We developed computer simulations to model the early spread of HIV-1 group M in Kinshasa before, during and after the estimated origin of the virus, using parameters derived from the colonial literature. These confirmed that the early 20(th) century was particularly permissive for the emergence of HIV by heterosexual transmission. The strongest potential facilitating factor was high GUD levels. Remarkably, the direct effects of city population size and circumcision frequency seemed relatively small. Our results suggest that intense GUD in promiscuous urban communities was the main factor driving HIV emergence. Low circumcision rates may have played a role, probably by their indirect effects on GUD.},

For patients who are motivated to take therapy and who have access to lifelong treatment, AIDS-related illnesses are no longer the primary threat, but a new set of HIV-associated complications have emerged, resulting in a novel chronic disease that for many will span several decades of life. Treatment does not fully restore immune health; as a result, several inflammation-associated or immunodeficiency complications such as cardiovascular disease and cancer are increasing in importance. Cumulative toxic effects from exposure to antiretroviral drugs for decades can cause clinically-relevant metabolic disturbances and end-organ damage. Concerns are growing that the multimorbidity associated with HIV disease could affect healthy ageing and overwhelm some health-care systems, particularly those in resource-limited regions that have yet to develop a chronic care model fully. In view of the problems inherent in the treatment and care for patients with a chronic disease that might persist for several decades, a global effort to identify a cure is now underway.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 primary transcript undergoes a complex splicing process by which more than 40 different spliced RNAs are generated. One of the factors contributing to HIV-1 splicing complexity is the multiplicity of 3' splice sites (3'ss) used for generation of rev RNAs, with two 3'ss, A4a and A4b, being most commonly used, a third site, A4c, used less frequently, and two additional sites, A4d and A4e, reported in only two and one isolates, respectively. HIV-1 splicing has been analyzed mostly in subtype B isolates, and data on other group M clades are lacking. Here we examine splice site usage in three primary isolates of subtype C, the most prevalent clade in the HIV-1 pandemic, by using an in vitro infection assay of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Viral spliced RNAs were identified by RT-PCR amplification using a fluorescently-labeled primer and software analyses and by cloning and sequencing the amplified products. The results revealed that splice site usage for generation of rev transcripts in subtype C differs from that reported for subtype B, with most rev RNAs using two previously unreported 3'ss, one located 7 nucleotides upstream of 3'ss A4a, designated A4f, preferentially used by two isolates, and another located 14 nucleotides upstream of 3'ss A4c, designated A4g, preferentially used by the third isolate. A new 5' splice site, designated D2a, was also identified in one virus. Usage of the newly identified splice sites is consistent with sequence features commonly found in subtype C viruses. These results show that splice site usage may differ between HIV-1 subtypes.},

Participants either had symptoms of HIV disease (if AIDS, with a CD4 cell count of > 50 x 10(6)/L) or a CD4 count of less than 350 x 10(6)/L; 2124 had not had zidovudine before (Delta 1) and 1083 had for at least 3 months (Delta 2).Over a median follow-up of 30 months, 699 participants died, and 936 of the 2765 without AIDS at entry developed AIDS or died. In participants who had not had AZT before, both combination regimens had substantial benefits in terms of survival (regardless of disease stage at entry); a relative reduction in mortality of 42\%, compared to AZT alone (95\% Cl 25\% to 55\%), for AZT plus ddl and of 32\% (95\% Cl 22\% to 47\%) for AZT plus ddC. In participants who had had AZT before, the addition of ddl improved survival (p = 0.05; relative reduction 23\% [95\% Cl 0\% to 41\%]) but there was no direct evidence of benefit from the addition of ddC (p = 0.47; relative reduction 9\% [95\% Cl--17\% to 29\%]). The overall difference in survival between the treatment groups was significant (p < 0.0001; a relative reduction in mortality, compared to AZT alone, of 33\% (95\% Cl 20\% to 44\%) for AZT plus ddl and 21\% (95\% Cl 6\% to 34\%) for AZT plus ddC). Benefit in terms of disease progression was seen mainly in participants not previously treated with AZT and overall. There was no unexpected toxicity from the combination treatments.Initiation of treatment with combinations of AZT plus ddl or ddC prolongs life and delays disease progression compared with AZT alone. The addition of ddl to participants already treated with AZT also improves survival, although the benefit appears less.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational prediction of microRNA targets remains a challenging problem. The existing rule-based, data-driven and expression profiling approaches to target prediction are mostly approached from the gene-level. The increasing availability of RNA-seq data provides a new perspective for microRNA target prediction on the isoform-level. We hypothesize that the splicing isoform is the ultimate effector in microRNA targeting and that the proposed isoform-level approach is capable of predicting non-dominant isoform targets as well as their targeting regions that are otherwise invisible to many existing approaches. To test the hypothesis, we used an iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to quantify transcriptomes at the isoform-level. The performance of the EM algorithm in transcriptome quantification was examined in simulation studies using FluxSimulator. We used joint evidence from isoform-level down-regulation and seed enrichment to predict microRNA-155 targets. We validated our computational approach using results from 149 in-house performed in vitro 3'-UTR assays. We also augmented the splicing database using exon-exon junction evidence, and applied the EM algorithm to predict and quantify 1572 cell line specific novel isoforms. Combined with seed enrichment analysis, we predicted 51 novel microRNA-155 isoform targets. Our work is among the first computational studies advocating the isoform-level microRNA target prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Pyrosequencing technology provides an important new approach to more extensively characterize diverse sequence populations and detect low frequency variants. However, the promise of this technology has been difficult to realize, as careful correction of sequencing errors is crucial to distinguish rare variants (∼1\%) in an infected host with high sensitivity and specificity.We developed a new approach, referred to as Indel and Carryforward Correction (ICC), to cluster sequences without substitutions and locally correct only indel and carryforward sequencing errors within clusters to ensure that no rare variants are lost. ICC performs sequence clustering in the order of (i) homopolymer indel patterns only, (ii) indel patterns only and (iii) carryforward errors only, without the requirement of a distance cutoff value. Overall, ICC removed 93-95\% of sequencing errors found in control datasets. On pyrosequencing data from a PCR fragment derived from 15 HIV-1 plasmid clones mixed at various frequencies as low as 0.1\%, ICC achieved the highest sensitivity and similar specificity compared with other commonly used error correction and variant calling algorithms.Availability and implementation: Source code is freely available for download at http://indra.mullins.microbiol.washington.edu/ICC.

Patients were followed until death or until 1 January 2000; median follow-up was 66 months.By Kaplan-Meier analyses, the median time to symptomatic HIV disease (CDC category B or C) was 3.0 years [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-5.0 years]. The median time to AIDS (CDC category C) was 5.2 years (95\% CI 4.7-6.5 years), and the median time to death was 7.4 years (95\% CI 6.2-10.2 years). Community-acquired infections, including respiratory tract infections, acute diarrhea, and skin infections were common in the pre-AIDS period. AIDS-defining illnesses included tuberculosis, wasting syndrome, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, candida esophagitis, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcal meningitis. Rapid progression to death was associated with anemia at the time of seroconversion hazards ratio (HR) 4.1 (95\% CI 1.1-15.0), age greater than 35 years at seroconversion HR 4.4 (95\% CI 1.1-16.6), and lymphopenia at seroconversion HR 11.0 (95\% CI 2.3-53.0).This report documents rapid disease progression from HIV seroconversion until death among patients living in a developing country. Interventions, including nutritional support and prophylaxis of common community-acquired infections during the pre-AIDS period may slow disease progression and prolong life for HIV-infected individuals in less-developed countries.},

Although many directly affect protein expression, an increasing proportion of mutations is now believed to influence mRNA splicing. They mostly affect existing splice sites, but synonymous, non-synonymous or nonsense mutations can also create or disrupt splice sites or auxiliary cis-splicing sequences. To facilitate the analysis of the different mutations, we designed Human Splicing Finder (HSF), a tool to predict the effects of mutations on splicing signals or to identify splicing motifs in any human sequence. It contains all available matrices for auxiliary sequence prediction as well as new ones for binding sites of the 9G8 and Tra2-beta Serine-Arginine proteins and the hnRNP A1 ribonucleoprotein. We also developed new Position Weight Matrices to assess the strength of 5' and 3' splice sites and branch points. We evaluated HSF efficiency using a set of 83 intronic and 35 exonic mutations known to result in splicing defects. We showed that the mutation effect was correctly predicted in almost all cases. HSF could thus represent a valuable resource for research, diagnostic and therapeutic (e.g. therapeutic exon skipping) purposes as well as for global studies, such as the GEN2PHEN European Project or the Human Variome Project.},

  Abstract                 = {The human intestinal microbiota is essential to the health of the host and plays a role in nutrition, development, metabolism, pathogen resistance, and regulation of immune responses. Antibiotics may disrupt these coevolved interactions, leading to acute or chronic disease in some individuals. Our understanding of antibiotic-associated disturbance of the microbiota has been limited by the poor sensitivity, inadequate resolution, and significant cost of current research methods. The use of pyrosequencing technology to generate large numbers of 16S rDNA sequence tags circumvents these limitations and has been shown to reveal previously unexplored aspects of the “rare biosphere.” We investigated the distal gut bacterial communities of three healthy humans before and after treatment with ciprofloxacin, obtaining more than 7,000 full-length rRNA sequences and over 900,000 pyrosequencing reads from two hypervariable regions of the rRNA gene. A companion paper in PLoS Genetics (see Huse et al., doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000255) shows that the taxonomic information obtained with these methods is concordant. Pyrosequencing of the V6 and V3 variable regions identified 3,300–5,700 taxa that collectively accounted for over 99% of the variable region sequence tags that could be obtained from these samples. Ciprofloxacin treatment influenced the abundance of about a third of the bacterial taxa in the gut, decreasing the taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of the community. However, the magnitude of this effect varied among individuals, and some taxa showed interindividual variation in the response to ciprofloxacin. While differences of community composition between individuals were the largest source of variability between samples, we found that two unrelated individuals shared a surprising degree of community similarity. In all three individuals, the taxonomic composition of the community closely resembled its pretreatment state by 4 weeks after the end of treatment, but several taxa failed to recover within 6 months. These pervasive effects of ciprofloxacin on community composition contrast with the reports by participants of normal intestinal function and with prior assumptions of only modest effects of ciprofloxacin on the intestinal microbiota. These observations support the hypothesis of functional redundancy in the human gut microbiota. The rapid return to the pretreatment community composition is indicative of factors promoting community resilience, the nature of which deserves future investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {ERV9 is a low repeated family of human endogenous retroviral elements, which has close to 50 members, in addition to at least 4000 solitary LTRs. Previous work has shown that randomly selected LTRs can promote transcription of reporter genes, raising the possibility that these sequences may affect the expression of adjacent cellular genes. We report here the structural organization in different primate species of a zinc-finger coding gene whose expression is driven in humans by a solitary ERV9-LTR promoter. Using a PCR strategy and library screening, we were able to trace the origin of the insertion event in the primate lineage and to evaluate the impact of this event on gene structure. Our findings indicate that the integration of the ERV9 element occurred after the split of orangutang from the great apes, but before the divergence of the gorilla lineage. These results suggest that ERV9 elements have been mobile within the primate lineages and may still be active in humans.},

The alpha- and beta 1-interferon genes have been assigned to this chromosome region (9p21-22). We now present evidence of the homozygous deletion of the interferon genes in neoplastic hematopoietic cell lines and primary leukemia cells in the presence or absence of chromosomal deletions that are detectable at the level of the light microscope. In these cell lines, the deletion of the interferon genes is accompanied by a deficiency of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.28), an enzyme of purine metabolism.

Analysis of fibrillin transcript from a patient with Marfan syndrome revealed the skipping of a constitutive exon containing a nonsense mutation. Similar results were observed for two nonsense mutations in the gene encoding ornithine delta-aminotransferase from patients with gyrate atrophy. All genomic DNA sequences flanking these exons that are known to influence RNA splicing were unaltered, which suggests that nonsense mutations can alter splice site selection in vivo.},

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrates into host chromatin to transcribe and replicate its genome. Lymphocytes harbouring a quiescent but inducible provirus are a challenge to viral eradication in infected patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Therefore, our understanding of the contribution of sub-nuclear positioning to viral transcription may also have far-reaching implications in the pathology of the infection. To gain an insight into the conformation of chromatin at the site of HIV-1 integration, we investigated lymphocytes carrying a single latent provirus. In the silenced state, the provirus was consistently found at the nuclear periphery, associated in trans with a pericentromeric region of chromosome 12 in a significant number of quiescent cells. After induction of the transcription, this association was lost, although the location of the transcribing provirus remained peripheral. These results, extended to several other cell clones, unveil a novel mechanism of transcriptional silencing involved in HIV-1 post-transcriptional latency and reinforce the notion that gene transcription may also occur at the nuclear periphery.},

We also combined this analysis with direct RNA sequencing (DRS) to reveal ESRP-mediated regulation of alternative polyadenylation. To define binding motifs that mediate direct regulation of splicing and polyadenylation by ESRP, SELEX-Seq analysis was performed, coupling traditional SELEX with high-throughput sequencing. Identification and scoring of high-affinity ESRP1 binding motifs within ESRP target genes allowed the generation of RNA maps that define the position-dependent activity of the ESRPs in regulating cassette exons and alternative 3' ends. These extensive analyses provide a comprehensive picture of the functions of the ESRPs in an epithelial posttranscriptional gene expression program.},

  Abstract                 = {The pathway causing CD4 T-cell death in HIV-infected hosts remains poorly understood although apoptosis has been proposed as a key mechanism. We now show that caspase-3-mediated apoptosis accounts for the death of only a small fraction of CD4 T cells corresponding to those that are both activated and productively infected. The remaining over 95\% of quiescent lymphoid CD4 T cells die by caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis triggered by abortive viral infection. Pyroptosis corresponds to an intensely inflammatory form of programmed cell death in which cytoplasmic contents and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, are released. This death pathway thus links the two signature events in HIV infection-CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation-and creates a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells release inflammatory signals that attract more cells to die. This cycle can be broken by caspase 1 inhibitors shown to be safe in humans, raising the possibility of a new class of 'anti-AIDS' therapeutics targeting the host rather than the virus.},

  Abstract                 = {The establishment of HIV-1 latency can result from limiting levels of transcription initiation or elongation factors, restrictive chromatin modifications, transcriptional interference, and insufficient Tat activity. Since the viral protein Tat can counteract many of these factors, we hypothesized that the presence of exogenous Tat during infection might inhibit the establishment of latency. This was explored using a Jurkat model of latency establishment and reactivation. PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed the latent state in this model and showed evidence of transcriptional interference. To address our hypothesis, cells undergoing infection were first exposed to either purified recombinant Tat or a transactivation-negative mutant. Only the former resulted in a modest inhibition of the establishment of latency. Next, Jurkat cells stably expressing intracellular Tat were used in our latency model to avoid limitations of Tat delivery. Experiments confirmed that intracellular Tat expression did not affect the susceptibility of these cells to viral infection. Eight weeks after infection, Jurkat cells expressing Tat harbored up to 1,700-fold fewer (P < 0.01) latent viruses than Jurkat cells that did not express Tat. Additionally, Tat delivered by a second virus was sufficient to reactivate most of the latent population. Our results suggest that inhibition of the establishment of latent infection is theoretically possible. In a hypothetical scenario of therapy that induces viral gene expression during acute infection, activation of viruses which would otherwise have entered latency could occur while concurrent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would prevent further viral spread, potentially decreasing the size of the established latent reservoir.},

One mutant, MuLV-SF1, contained a single base substitution (C to T at base 4950) that resulted in an arginine to cysteine change in a region highly conserved among retroviruses. Mutant DNA, introduced into rat cells by cotransfection with a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSV tk), directed production of virus particles with reverse transcriptase activity. Infection of cells with these particles led to synthesis of full-length linear and circular forms of unintegrated viral DNA; however, integrated viral DNA was decreased at least by a factor of 10 when examined by DNA hybridization, and the mutant particles were less efficient then wild-type virus at establishing an infection by a factor of at least 300. Pseudotypes formed with the proteins of MuLV-SF1 and the genome of a replication defective marker MuLV, carrying the HSV tk gene, were less effective by at least a factor of 100 in producing tk+ colonies than pseudotypes formed with proteins encoded by wild-type virus. When the MuLV-SF1 pseudotypes did produce tk+ cells, most of the proviruses were integrated aberrantly. We conclude that the MuLV-SF1 pol gene is defective for a function that is required for normal integrative recombination and dissociable from DNA synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Macrophages are important targets and long-lived reservoirs of HIV-1, which are not cleared of infection by currently available treatments. In the primary monocyte-derived macrophage model of infection, replication is initially productive followed by a decline in virion output over ensuing weeks, coincident with a decrease in the levels of the essential viral transactivator protein Tat. We investigated two possible mechanisms in macrophages for regulation of viral replication, which appears to be primarily regulated at the level of tat mRNA: 1) differential mRNA stability, used by cells and some viruses for the rapid regulation of gene expression and 2) control of HIV-1 alternative splicing, which is essential for optimal viral replication.Following termination of transcription at increasing times after infection in macrophages, we found that tat mRNA did indeed decay more rapidly than rev or nef mRNA, but with similar kinetics throughout infection. In addition, tat mRNA decayed at least as rapidly in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Expression of cellular splicing factors in uninfected and infected macrophage cultures from the same donor showed an inverse pattern over time between enhancing factors (members of the SR family of RNA binding proteins) and inhibitory factors (members of the hnRNP family). While levels of the SR protein SC35 were greatly up-regulated in the first week or two after infection, hnRNPs of the A/B and H groups were down-regulated. Around the peak of virus production in each culture, SC35 expression declined to levels in uninfected cells or lower, while the hnRNPs increased to control levels or above. We also found evidence for increased cytoplasmic expression of SC35 following long-term infection.While no evidence of differential regulation of tat mRNA decay was found in macrophages following HIV-1 infection, changes in the balance of cellular splicing factors which regulate alternative viral pre-mRNA splicing were observed. These changes correlated with changes in Tat expression and virus production and could play an important role in viral persistence in macrophages. This mechanism could provide a novel target for control of infection in this critical cell type, which would be necessary for eventual eradication of the virus from infected individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represents a multigene family that is known to display allelic and gene copy number variations. Primate species such as humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) show DRB region configuration polymorphism at the population level, meaning that the number and content of DRB loci may vary per haplotype. Introns of primate DRB alleles differ significantly in length due to insertions of transposable elements as long endogenous retrovirus (ERV) and human ERV (HERV) sequences in the DRB2, DRB6, and DRB7 pseudogenes. Although the integration of intronic HERVs resulted sooner or later in the inactivation of the targeted genes, the fixation of these endogenous retroviral segments over long time spans seems to have provided evolutionary advantage. Intronic HERVs may have integrated in a sense or an antisense manner. On the one hand, antisense-oriented retroelements such as HERV-K14I, observed in intron 2 of the DRB7 genes in humans and chimpanzees, seem to promote stability, as configurations/alleles containing these hits have experienced strong conservative selection during primate evolution. On the other hand, the HERVK3I present in intron 1 of all DRB2 and/or DRB6 alleles tested so far integrated in a sense orientation. The data suggest that multigenic regions in particular may benefit from sense introgressions by HERVs, as these elements seem to promote and maintain the generation of diversity, whereas these types of integrations may be lethal in monogenic systems, since they are known to influence transcript regulation negatively.},

  Abstract                 = {Robustness seems to be the opposite of evolvability. If phenotypes are robust against mutation, we might expect that a population will have difficulty adapting to an environmental change, as several studies have suggested. However, other studies contend that robust organisms are more adaptable. A quantitative understanding of the relationship between robustness and evolvability will help resolve these conflicting reports and will clarify outstanding problems in molecular and experimental evolution, evolutionary developmental biology and protein engineering. Here we demonstrate, using a general population genetics model, that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure of the fitness landscape. In particular, neutral diversity in a robust population can accelerate adaptation as long as the number of phenotypes accessible to an individual by mutation is smaller than the total number of phenotypes in the fitness landscape. These results provide a quantitative resolution to a significant ambiguity in evolutionary theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research has emphasized the notion that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latency is controlled by a restrictive histone code at, or DNA methylation of, the integrated viral promoter (long terminal repeat [LTR]). The present concept of HIV-1 latency has essentially been patterned from the principles of cellular gene regulation. Here we introduce an experimental system that allows for the qualitative and quantitative kinetic study of latency establishment and maintenance at the population level. In this system, we find no evidence that HIV-1 latency establishment is the consequence of downregulation of initial active infection followed by the establishment of a restrictive histone code at the viral LTR. Latent infection was established following integration of the virus in the absence of viral gene expression (silent integration) and was a function of the NF-{kappa}B activation level in the host cell at the time of infection. In the absence of a role for epigenetic regulation, we demonstrate that transcriptional interference, a mechanism that has recently been suggested to add to the stabilization of HIV-1 latency, is the primary mechanism to govern latency maintenance. These findings provide direct experimental evidence that the high number of viral integration events (>90%) found in actively expressed genes of CD4+ memory T cells from highly active antiretroviral therapy-suppressed patients represent indeed latent infection events and that transcriptional interference may be the primary mechanism to control HIV-1 latency in vivo. HIV-1 latency may thus not be governed by the principles of cellular gene regulation, and therapeutic strategies to deplete the pool of latently HIV-1-infected cells should be reconsidered.},

Subtypes were compared on the rate of CD4 cell decline using a multi-level random effects model. Virological response to ART was compared using the time to virological suppression (< 400 copies/ml) and rate of virological rebound (> 400 copies/ml) following initial suppression.Complete subtype and epidemiological data were available for 679 patients, of whom 357 (52.6\%) were white and 230 (33.9\%) were black African. Subtype B (n = 394) accounted for the majority of infections, followed by subtypes C (n = 125), A (n = 84), D (n = 51) and CRF02-AG (n = 25). There were no significant differences in rate of CD4 cell decline, initial response to highly active antiretroviral therapy and subsequent rate of virological rebound for subtypes B, A, C and CRF02-AG. However, a statistically significant four-fold faster rate of CD4 decline (after adjustment for gender, ethnicity and baseline CD4 count) was observed for subtype D. In addition, subtype D infections showed a higher rate of virological rebound at six months (70\%) compared with subtypes B (45\%, p = 0.02), A (35\%, p = 0.004) and C (34\%, p = 0.01)This is the first study from an industrialized country to show a faster CD4 cell decline and higher rate of subsequent virological failure with subtype D infection. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the greater virulence of subtype D.},

Likewise, in the early days of sequence comparison, alignment scores were straightforward stuff that anybody could tweak. The first sequence comparisons just assigned -1 per mismatch and -1 per insertion/deletion, and if you didn't like that, you could make up whatever scores you thought gave you better-looking alignments. Those days are gone. Look inside a modern amino acid score matrix, and you'll see a squirrel's nest of 400 numbers. These highly tuned matrices, which go by industrialized acronyms like BLOSUM62 and PAM250, no longer seem to have any user serviceable parts inside. Blame probability theory.},

Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs.

Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3%, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Two key features of RNA viruses are their compacted genomes and their high mutation rate. Accordingly, deleterious mutations are common and have an enormous impact on viral fitness. In their multicellular hosts, robustness can be achieved by genomic redundancy, including gene duplication, diploidy, alternative metabolic pathways and biochemical buffering mechanisms. However, here we review evidence suggesting that during RNA virus evolution, alternative robustness mechanisms may have been selected. After briefly describing how genetic robustness can be quantified, we discuss mechanisms of intrinsic robustness arising as consequences of RNA-genome architecture, replication peculiarities and quasi-species population dynamics. These intrinsic robustness mechanisms operate efficiently at the population level, despite the mutational sensitivity shown by individual genomes. Finally, we discuss the possibility that viruses might exploit cellular buffering mechanisms for their own benefit, producing a sort of extrinsic robustness.},

Analysis of the reaction products showed that HIV integration in vitro accurately reproduces the in vivo process. Integration occurred without apparent specificity for the target sequence, and the integrated provirus was directly flanked by a 5-base-pair duplication of DNA from the target site. HIV integration did not require a high-energy cofactor, and the enzymatic activities required for integration were recovered with the viral DNA when cell extracts were fractionated by gel exclusion chromatography.},

In the absence of cotransfection with a plasmid expressing Rev, envelope-specific RNA is retained in the nucleus. Several cis-acting sites in the envelope are involved, one of which is between nucleotides 7330 and 7735 and is required for the response to Rev. Other sequences (nucleotides 5797-7330 and 7735-7989) are involved in the apparent retention of the envelope-specific RNA in the nucleus in the absence of Rev and its response element. Because Rev affects the localization of envelope RNA both in the presence and in the absence of the normal splice sites on the RNA, the mechanism of Rev action is independent of splicing.},

Here, we present an evolutionary analysis of one such gene family, the poly-zinc-finger (poly-ZF) genes. The human genome encodes approximately 700 members of the poly-ZF family of putative transcriptional repressors, many of which have associated KRAB, SCAN, or BTB domains. Analysis of the gene family across the tree of life indicates that the gene family arose from a small ancestral group of eukaryotic zinc-finger transcription factors through many repeated gene duplications accompanied by functional divergence. The ancestral gene family has probably expanded independently in several lineages, including mammals and some fishes. Investigation of adaptive evolution among recent paralogs using d(N)/d(S) analysis indicates that a major component of the selective pressure acting on these genes has been positive selection to change their DNA-binding specificity. These results suggest that the poly-ZF genes are a major source of new transcriptional repression activity in humans and other primates.},

The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Purified HIV-1 integration protein carries out both of these steps in vitro. Two novel forms of the dinucleotide cleaved from HIV-1 DNA were identified and one, a cyclic dinucleotide, was used to analyze the stereochemical course of viral DNA cleavage. Both viral DNA cleavage and DNA strand transfer display inversion at chiral phosphorothioates during the course of the reaction.

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 Tat activates transcription of HIV-1 viral genes by inducing phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Tat can also disturb cellular metabolism by inhibiting proliferation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes and by inducing cellular apoptosis. Tat-induced apoptosis of T-cells is attributed, in part, to the distortion of microtubules polymerization. LIS1 is a microtubule-associated protein that facilitates microtubule polymerization.We identified here LIS1 as a Tat-interacting protein during extensive biochemical fractionation of T-cell extracts. We found several proteins to co-purify with a Tat-associated RNAPII CTD kinase activity including LIS1, CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1. Tat interacted with LIS1 but not with CDK7, cyclin H or MAT1 in vitro. LIS1 also co-immunoprecipitated with Tat expressed in HeLa cells. Further, LIS1 interacted with Tat in a yeast two-hybrid system.Our results indicate that Tat interacts with LIS1 in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction might contribute to the effect of Tat on microtubule formation.},

  Abstract                 = {The diversity of virus populations within single infected hosts presents a major difficulty for the natural immune response as well as for vaccine design and antiviral drug therapy. Recently developed pyrophosphate-based sequencing technologies (pyrosequencing) can be used for quantifying this diversity by ultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for the analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing data obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of the sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a statistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm for constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this set of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the frequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population reconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences obtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV populations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of the structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral evolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.},

Although individual modifications have been linked to the activity levels of various genetic functional elements, their combinatorial patterns are still unresolved and their potential for systematic de novo genome annotation remains untapped. Here, we use a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to reveal 'chromatin states' in human T cells, based on recurrent and spatially coherent combinations of chromatin marks. We define 51 distinct chromatin states, including promoter-associated, transcription-associated, active intergenic, large-scale repressed and repeat-associated states. Each chromatin state shows specific enrichments in functional annotations, sequence motifs and specific experimentally observed characteristics, suggesting distinct biological roles. This approach provides a complementary functional annotation of the human genome that reveals the genome-wide locations of diverse classes of epigenetic function.},

We studied the activity and safety of lamivudine plus zidovudine as compared with either drug alone as treatment for patients with HIV infection, most of whom had not previously received zidovudine.Three hundred sixty-six patients with 200 to 500 CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter who had received zidovudine for four weeks or less were randomly assigned to treatment with one of four regimens: 300 mg of lamivudine every 12 hours; 200 mg of zidovudine every 8 hours; 150 mg of lamivudine every 12 hours plus zidovudine; or 300 mg of lamivudine every 12 hours plus zidovudine. The study was double-blind and lasted 24 weeks, with an extension phase for another 28 weeks.Over the 24-week period, the low-dose and high-dose regimens combining lamivudine and zidovudine were associated with greater increases in the CD4+ cell count (P = 0.002 and P = 0.015, respectively) and the percentage of CD4+ cells (P < 0.001 for both) and with greater decreases in plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA (P < 0.001 for both) than was treatment with zidovudine alone. Combination therapy was also more effective than lamivudine alone in lowering plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increasing the percentage of CD4+ cells (P < 0.001 for all comparisons), and these advantages persisted through 52 weeks. Adverse events were no more frequent with combination therapy than with zidovudine alone.In HIV-infected patients with little or no prior antiretroviral therapy, treatment with a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine is well tolerated over a one-year period and produces more improvement in immunologic and virologic measures than does treatment with either agent alone.},

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) offers unprecedented power to capture the real dynamics of gene expression. Experimental designs with extensive biological replication present a unique opportunity to exploit this feature and distinguish expression profiles with higher resolution. RNA-seq data analysis methods so far have been mostly applied to data sets with few replicates and their default settings try to provide the best performance under this constraint. These methods are based on two well-known count data distributions: the Poisson and the negative binomial. The way to properly calibrate them with large RNA-seq data sets is not trivial for the non-expert bioinformatics user.Here we show that expression profiles produced by extensively-replicated RNA-seq experiments lead to a rich diversity of count data distributions beyond the Poisson and the negative binomial, such as Poisson-Inverse Gaussian or Pólya-Aeppli, which can be captured by a more general family of count data distributions called the Poisson-Tweedie. The flexibility of the Poisson-Tweedie family enables a direct fitting of emerging features of large expression profiles, such as heavy-tails or zero-inflation, without the need to alter a single configuration parameter. We provide a software package for R called tweeDEseq implementing a new test for differential expression based on the Poisson-Tweedie family. Using simulations on synthetic and real RNA-seq data we show that tweeDEseq yields P-values that are equally or more accurate than competing methods under different configuration parameters. By surveying the tiny fraction of sex-specific gene expression changes in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, we also show that tweeDEseq accurately detects differentially expressed genes in a real large RNA-seq data set with improved performance and reproducibility over the previously compared methodologies. Finally, we compared the results with those obtained from microarrays in order to check for reproducibility.RNA-seq data with many replicates leads to a handful of count data distributions which can be accurately estimated with the statistical model illustrated in this paper. This method provides a better fit to the underlying biological variability; this may be critical when comparing groups of RNA-seq samples with markedly different count data distributions. The tweeDEseq package forms part of the Bioconductor project and it is available for download at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

We found that DNase I digestion effectively reduced HERV-K RT-PCR positive signal. We also found that levels of HERV-K expression did not correlate with HIV-1 viral load.

  Abstract                 = {Over 40 different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNAs are produced by alternative splicing of the primary HIV-1 RNA transcripts. In addition, approximately half of the viral RNA remains unspliced and is used as genomic RNA and as mRNA for the Gag and Pol gene products. Regulation of splicing at the HIV-1 3' splice sites (3'ss) requires suboptimal polypyrimidine tracts, and positive or negative regulation occurs through the binding of cellular factors to cis-acting splicing regulatory elements. We have previously shown that splicing at HIV-1 3'ss A1, which produces single-spliced vif mRNA and promotes the inclusion of HIV exon 2 into both completely and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, is increased by optimizing the 5' splice site (5'ss) downstream of exon 2 (5'ss D2). Here we show that the mutations within 5'ss D2 that are predicted to lower or increase the affinity of the 5'ss for U1 snRNP result in reduced or increased Vif expression, respectively. Splicing at 5'ss D2 was not necessary for the effect of 5'ss D2 on Vif expression. In addition, we have found that mutations of the GGGG motif proximal to the 5'ss D2 increase exon 2 inclusion and Vif expression. Finally, we report the presence of a novel exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) element within the 5'-proximal region of exon 2 that facilitates both exon inclusion and Vif expression. This ESE binds specifically to the cellular SR protein SRp75. Our results suggest that the 5'ss D2, the proximal GGGG silencer, and the ESE act competitively to determine the level of vif mRNA splicing and Vif expression. We propose that these positive and negative splicing elements act together to allow the accumulation of vif mRNA and unspliced HIV-1 mRNA, compatible with optimal virus replication.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional experimental methods of studying the human genome are limited by the inability to independently study the combination of alleles, or haplotype, on each of the homologous copies of the chromosomes. We developed a microfluidic device capable of separating and amplifying homologous copies of each chromosome from a single human metaphase cell. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of amplified DNA enabled us to achieve completely deterministic, whole-genome, personal haplotypes of four individuals, including a HapMap trio with European ancestry (CEU) and an unrelated European individual. The phases of alleles were determined at ∼99.8\% accuracy for up to ∼96\% of all assayed SNPs. We demonstrate several practical applications, including direct observation of recombination events in a family trio, deterministic phasing of deletions in individuals and direct measurement of the human leukocyte antigen haplotypes of an individual. Our approach has potential applications in personal genomics, single-cell genomics and statistical genetics.},

Serial, complete HIV-1 RNA sequence analyses were performed for seven untreated long-term survivors. Sequences were subjected to computational analysis.One woman had evidence of both superinfection and recombination. Complete HIV-1 RNA sequences were first derived from plasma obtained in 1986, when the woman had been HIV seropositive for at least 21 months; this sequence was entirely subtype A. The sequences obtained from plasma in 1995 and 1997, however, were subtype A/C recombinants with a SimPlot demonstrating that the subtype A fragment in 1995 and 1997 was derived from the original 1986 A sequence. Heteroduplex tracking assays demonstrated that the subtype C sequences were not detectable as minor species in 1986.Intersubtype recombination took place between the original non-recombinant subtype A strain and the superinfecting subtype C strain in an untreated, chronically infected woman. This finding helps to explain the rising prevalence of recombinant HIV-1 worldwide. Recombination resulting from superinfection with diverse strains may pose problems for eliciting broad immune responses necessary for an effective vaccine.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that play a central role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to target mRNAs. Several studies have revealed alterations in cellular miRNA profiles following HIV-1 infection, mostly for miRNAs involved in inhibiting viral infection. These miRNA expression modifications might also serve to block the innate HIV-1 inhibition mechanism. As a result, it is expected that during HIV-1 infection miRNAs target genes that hinder or prevent the progression of the HIV-1 replication cycle. One of the major sets of genes known to inhibit the progression of HIV-1 infection are cellular restriction factors. In this study, we identified a direct miRNA target gene that modulates viral spread in T-lymphocytes and HeLa-CCR5 cell lines. Following infection, let-7c, miR-34a or miR-124a were upregulated, and they targeted and downregulated p21 and TASK1 (also known as CDKN1A and KCNK3, respectively) cellular proteins. This eventually led to increased virion release and higher copy number of viral genome transcripts in infected cells. Conversely, by downregulating these miRNAs, we could suppress viral replication and spread. Our data suggest that HIV-1 exploits the host miRNA cellular systems in order to block the innate inhibition mechanism, allowing a more efficient infection process.},

Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. The epidemic histories of HIV-1 group M and nonpandemic group O were similar until ~1960, after which group M underwent an epidemiological transition and outpaced regional population growth. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Lifetime costs of care and quality-of-life estimates for HIV-infected persons depend on the disease stage at which these persons are diagnosed, enter care, and start antiretroviral therapy. Updated estimates were used to analyze the effects of late versus early diagnosis/entry on US lifetime care costs, quality-of-life estimates, and HIV transmissions.The Progression and Transmission of HIV/AIDS model was used to estimate discounted (3\%) lifetime treatment costs ($US 2011) and quality-of-life variables from time of infection for cohorts of 10,000 HIV-infected index patients in 4 categories of CD4 count at diagnosis: (I) ≤200 cells/μL, (II) 201-350 cells/μL, (III) 351-500 cells/μL, and (IV) 501-900 cells/μL. It is assumed that index patient diagnoses were uniformly distributed across the CD4 count range in each category and that patients entered care at the time of diagnosis, remained in care, and were eligible to initiate antiretroviral therapy at a CD4 count of 500 cells/μL. Lifetime transmissions of the index patients were also estimated.Discounted average lifetime costs varied from $253,000 for category I index patients to $402,000 for category IV patients. Discounted quality-adjusted life years lost decreased from 7.95 to 4.45 across these categories, additional years of life expectancy increased from 30.8 to 38.1, and lifetime transmissions decreased from 1.40 to 0.72.Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection increases lifetime costs but improves length and quality of life and reduces the number of new infections transmitted by nearly 50\%.},

  Abstract                 = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and unknown evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences. Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms, each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability. An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in eight mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 protein Nef enhances viral pathogenicity and accelerates disease progression in vivo. Nef potentiates T cell activation by an unknown mechanism, probably by optimizing the intracellular environment for HIV replication. Using a new T cell reporter system, we have found that Nef more than doubles the number of cells expressing the transcription factors NF-kappaB and NFAT after TCR stimulation. This Nef-induced priming of TCR signaling pathways occurred independently of calcium signaling and involved a very proximal step before protein kinase C activation. Engagement of the TCR by MHC-bound Ag triggers the formation of the immunological synapse by recruiting detergent-resistant membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts. Approximately 5-10\% of the total cellular pool of Nef is localized within lipid rafts. Using confocal and real-time microscopy, we found that Nef in lipid rafts was recruited into the immunological synapse within minutes after Ab engagement of the TCR/CD3 and CD28 receptors. This recruitment was dependent on the N-terminal domain of Nef encompassing its myristoylation. Nef did not increase the number of cell surface lipid rafts or immunological synapses. Recently, studies have shown a specific interaction of Nef with an active subpopulation of p21-activated kinase-2 found only in the lipid rafts. Thus, the corecruitment of Nef and key cellular partners (e.g., activated p21-activated kinase-2) into the immunological synapse may underlie the increased frequency of cells expressing transcriptionally active forms of NF-kappaB and NFAT and the resultant changes in T cell activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), and efavirenz (EFV) are the three components of the once-daily, single tablet regimen (Atripla) for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Previous cell culture studies have demonstrated that the double combination of tenofovir (TFV), the parent drug of TDF, and FTC were additive to synergistic in their anti-HIV activity, which correlated with increased levels of intracellular phosphorylation of both compounds.In this study, we demonstrated the combinations of TFV+FTC, TFV+EFV, FTC+EFV, and TFV+FTC+EFV synergistically inhibit HIV replication in cell culture and synergistically inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzed DNA synthesis in biochemical assays. Several different methods were applied to define synergy including median-effect analysis, MacSynergyII and quantitative isobologram analysis. We demonstrated that the enhanced formation of dead-end complexes (DEC) by HIV-1 RT and TFV-terminated DNA in the presence of FTC-triphosphate (TP) could contribute to the synergy observed for the combination of TFV+FTC, possibly through reduced terminal NRTI excision. Furthermore, we showed that EFV facilitated efficient formation of stable, DEC-like complexes by TFV- or FTC-monophosphate (MP)-terminated DNA and this can contribute to the synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 RT by TFV-diphosphate (DP)+EFV and FTC-TP+EFV combinations.This study demonstrated a clear correlation between the synergistic antiviral activities of TFV+FTC, TFV+EFV, FTC+EFV, and TFV+FTC+EFV combinations and synergistic HIV-1 RT inhibition at the enzymatic level. We propose the molecular mechanisms for the TFV+FTC+EFV synergy to be a combination of increased levels of the active metabolites TFV-DP and FTC-TP and enhanced DEC formation by a chain-terminated DNA and HIV-1 RT in the presence of the second and the third drug in the combination. This study furthers the understanding of the longstanding observations of synergistic anti-HIV-1 effects of many NRTI+NNRTI and certain NRTI+NRTI combinations in cell culture, and provides biochemical evidence that combinations of anti-HIV agents can increase the intracellular drug efficacy, without increasing the extracellular drug concentrations.},

We and others have shown an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells among circulating CD4+ (and CD8+) T cells of HIV-seropositive individuals and an increase in frequency of apoptosis with disease progression. However, it is not known if this apoptosis occurs in infected or uninfected T cells. We show here, using in situ labelling of lymph nodes from HIV-infected children and SIV-infected macaques, that apoptosis occurs predominantly in bystander cells and not in the productively infected cells themselves.

The frequency of resting CD4+ T cells harboring latent HIV-1 was low, 0.2 to 16.4 per 10(6) cells, and, in cross-sectional analysis, did not decrease with increasing time on therapy. The recovered viruses generally did not show mutations associated with resistance to the relevant antiretroviral drugs. This reservoir of nonevolving latent virus in resting CD4+ T cells should be considered in deciding whether to terminate treatment in patients who respond to HAART.},

  Abstract                 = {The Rev trans-activator of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a protein that regulates the simultaneous appearance in the cytoplasm of both spliced and unspliced forms of viral mRNAs from the same viral transcripts by way of recognition of a target sequence termed the Rev-responsive element (RRE). Whether Rev acts directly on RNA export or by inhibition of splicing, or both, is still a matter of debate. We have addressed this issue in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjecting RNA molecules containing RRE along with purified recombinant Rev protein into the oocyte nuclei. Adenovirus pre-mRNA containing an RRE in the intron was spliced equally well in the absence and presence of Rev protein. Only in the presence of Rev was non-spliced pre-mRNA exported from the nucleus; more surprisingly, the excised intron lariat (containing RRE) was also exported. Furthermore, an RRE-containing mRNA molecule that lacked intron sequences was also efficiently exported from the nucleus in a Rev-dependent manner. Therefore our results demonstrate that Rev can act directly at the level of nuclear export, independent of any inhibitory effect that it may exert on the splicing of pre-mRNA. Finally, our finding that the Rev mutant M10, shown previously to be inactive in human lymphoid cells, was also unable to export RRE-containing RNA molecules from oocyte nuclei suggests that one or more cellular factors, evolutionarily conserved between humans and Xenopus, interact with Rev in both cell systems to promote nuclear RNA export.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 Rev protein induces the nuclear export of intron-containing viral mRNAs that harbor its binding site, the Rev response element (RRE). A leucine-rich region of Rev, the activation domain, is essential for function and has been shown to be a nuclear export signal (NES). Although Rev exports viral RNAs that resemble cellular mRNAs, competition studies performed using microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes have previously indicated that Rev utilizes a non-mRNA export pathway. Here, we show that Rev is able to induce the export of both spliceable and non-spliceable RRE-containing pre-mRNAs and that this activity is not dependent on the location of the RRE within the RNA. Importantly, even RNA molecules of different classes, such as U3 snoRNA and U6 snRNA, which are retained in the nucleus by non-pre-mRNA mechanisms, are exported to the cytoplasm in response to Rev. Consistent with the notion that Rev-mediated export of RRE-containing RNA is mechanistically distinct from the export of processed cellular mRNA, a chimeric Rev protein in which its NES is replaced by the NES of hnRNP A1 does not induce the export of a Rev-responsive mRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that Rev/RRE-activated RNA export is, like other nuclear export pathways, linked to the Ran-GTPase cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {We used ultra-deep sequencing to obtain tens of thousands of HIV-1 sequences from regions targeted by CD8+ T lymphocytes from longitudinal samples from three acutely infected subjects, and modeled viral evolution during the critical first weeks of infection. Previous studies suggested that a single virus established productive infection, but these conclusions were tempered because of limited sampling; now, we have greatly increased our confidence in this observation through modeling the observed earliest sample diversity based on vastly more extensive sampling. Conventional sequencing of HIV-1 from acute/early infection has shown different patterns of escape at different epitopes; we investigated the earliest escapes in exquisite detail. Over 3-6 weeks, ultradeep sequencing revealed that the virus explored an extraordinary array of potential escape routes in the process of evading the earliest CD8 T-lymphocyte responses--using 454 sequencing, we identified over 50 variant forms of each targeted epitope during early immune escape, while only 2-7 variants were detected in the same samples via conventional sequencing. In contrast to the diversity seen within epitopes, non-epitope regions, including the Envelope V3 region, which was sequenced as a control in each subject, displayed very low levels of variation. In early infection, in the regions sequenced, the consensus forms did not have a fitness advantage large enough to trigger reversion to consensus amino acids in the absence of immune pressure. In one subject, a genetic bottleneck was observed, with extensive diversity at the second time point narrowing to two dominant escape forms by the third time point, all within two months of infection. Traces of immune escape were observed in the earliest samples, suggesting that immune pressure is present and effective earlier than previously reported; quantifying the loss rate of the founder virus suggests a direct role for CD8 T-lymphocyte responses in viral containment after peak viremia. Dramatic shifts in the frequencies of epitope variants during the first weeks of infection revealed a complex interplay between viral fitness and immune escape.},

The subjects were stratified according to numbers of T cells with CD4 surface markers and were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg of AZT or placebo by mouth every four hours for a total of 24 weeks. One hundred forty-five subjects received AZT, and 137 received placebo. When the study was terminated, 27 subjects had completed 24 weeks of the study, 152 had completed 16 weeks, and the remainder had completed at least 8 weeks. Nineteen placebo recipients and 1 AZT recipient died during the study (P less than 0.001). Opportunistic infections developed in 45 subjects receiving placebo, as compared with 24 receiving AZT. The base-line Karnofsky performance score and weight increased significantly among AZT recipients (P less than 0.001). A statistically significant increase in the number of CD4 cells was noted in subjects receiving AZT (P less than 0.001). After 12 weeks, the number of CD4 cells declined to pretreatment values among AZT recipients with AIDS but not amonG AZT recipients with AIDS-related complex. Skin-test anergy was partially reversed in 29 percent of subjects receiving AZT, as compared with 9 percent of those receiving placebo (P less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that AZT administration can decrease mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in a selected group of subjects with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, at least over the 8 to 24 weeks of observation in this study.},

The consensus sequence from the second sample contained a unique double mutation (ACT to GAT) in the codon for reverse transcriptase amino acid 69, causing substitution of aspartic acid (Asp) for the wild-type threonine (Thr). A mutation (ACA to ATA) also occurred in the codon for position 165, causing substitution of isoleucine (Ile) for Thr. The GAT (Asp) codon was introduced into the pol gene of a molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus via site-directed mutagenesis. Following transfection, mutant and wild-type viruses were tested for susceptibility to ddC by a plaque reduction assay. The mutant virus was fivefold less susceptible to ddC than the wild type; cross-resistance to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine or 2'3'-dideoxyinosine was not found. The Ile-165 mutation did not confer additional ddC resistance. The Asp-69 substitution may have contributed to the generation of resistant virus in this patient.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the direct detection of DNA methylation, without bisulfite conversion, through single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing. In SMRT sequencing, DNA polymerases catalyze the incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides into complementary nucleic acid strands. The arrival times and durations of the resulting fluorescence pulses yield information about polymerase kinetics and allow direct detection of modified nucleotides in the DNA template, including N6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Measurement of polymerase kinetics is an intrinsic part of SMRT sequencing and does not adversely affect determination of primary DNA sequence. The various modifications affect polymerase kinetics differently, allowing discrimination between them. We used these kinetic signatures to identify adenine methylation in genomic samples and found that, in combination with circular consensus sequencing, they can enable single-molecule identification of epigenetic modifications with base-pair resolution. This method is amenable to long read lengths and will likely enable mapping of methylation patterns in even highly repetitive genomic regions.},

Detection of K103N was independently associated with detection of K103N 6-8 weeks after the first SD NVP exposure and with pre-NVP viral load. The portion of women with undetectable K103N by 2 years after SD NVP administration was similar after first versus second use of SD NVP for pMTCT. K103N was undetectable in 93.2\% of evaluable women by 3 years of re-exposure. Only two of four women who received SD NVP in two pregnancies during the follow-up study had K103N detected after the last SD NVP exposure.K103N was detected in some women within 1 year of SD NVP re-exposure, but faded from detection in most women by 3 years after re-exposure.

  Abstract                 = {A model system for cytokine-induced up-regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) expression in chronically infected promonocyte clones was established. The parent promonocyte cell line U937 was chronically infected with HIV-1 and from this line a clone, U1, was derived. U1 showed minimal constitutive expression of HIV-1, but virus expression was markedly up-regulated by a phytohemagglutinin-induced supernatant containing multiple cytokines and by recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone. Recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not up-regulate virus expression. Concomitant with the cytokine-induced up-regulation of HIV-1, expression of membrane-bound IL-1 beta was selectively induced in U1 in the absence of induction of other surface membrane proteins. This cytokine up-regulation of IL-1 beta was not seen in the uninfected parent U937 cell line. These studies have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of progression from a latent or low-level HIV-1 infection to a productive infection with resulting immunosuppression. In addition, this model can be used to delineate the potential mechanisms whereby HIV-1 infection regulates cellular gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are tightly coupled gene expression events in eukaryotic cells. An interaction between the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase (Pol) II and components of the splicing machinery is postulated to mediate this coupling. Here, we show that splicing factors function directly to promote transcriptional elongation, demonstrating that transcription is more intimately coupled to splicing than previously thought. The spliceosomal U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) interact with human transcription elongation factor TAT-SF1 (refs 6,7,8,9) and strongly stimulate polymerase elongation when directed to an intron-free human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) template. This effect is likely to be mediated through the binding of TAT-SF1 to elongation factor P-TEFb, a proposed component of the transcription elongation complex. Inclusion of splicing signals in the nascent transcript further stimulates transcription, supporting the notion that the recruitment of U snRNPs near the elongating polymerase is important for transcription. Because the TAT-SF1-U snRNP complex also stimulates splicing in vitro, it may serve as a dual-function factor to couple transcription and splicing and to facilitate their reciprocal activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Metallic subwavelength apertures can be used in epi-illumination fluorescence to achieve focal volume confinement. Because of the near field components inherent to small metallic structures, observation volumes are formed that are much smaller than the conventional diffraction limited volume attainable by high numerical aperture far field optics (circa a femtoliter). Observation volumes in the range of 10-4 fl have been reported previously. Such apertures can be used for single-molecule detection at relatively high concentrations (up to 20 uM) of fluorophores. Here, we present a novel fabrication of metallic subwavelength apertures in the visible range. Using a new electron beam lithography process, uniform arrays of such apertures can be manufactured efficiently in large numbers with diameters in the range of 60–100 nm. The apertures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, focused ion beam cross sections/transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements, which confirmed their geometry and optical confinement. Process throughput can be further increased using deep ultraviolet photolithography to replace electron beam lithography. This enables the production of aperture arrays in a high volume manufacturing environment.},

We show that long terminal repeat (LTR)-derived transcripts contribute extensively to the complexity of the stem cell nuclear transcriptome.

Although Vpr does not encode a sequence that is recognizable as a nuclear localization signal (NLS), Vpr functions as a transferable NLS both in somatic cells and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In certain contexts, Vpr also mediates substantial accumulation at the nuclear envelope and, in particular, at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Consistent with this, Vpr is shown to interact specifically with nucleoporin phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat regions. These findings not only demonstrate that Vpr harbors a bona fide NLS but also raise the possibility that one (or more) of Vpr's functions may take place at the NPC.},

  Abstract                 = {A leading idea about how disturbances and other environmental fluctuations affect species diversity is the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). The IDH states that diversity of competing species is, or should be expected to be, maximized at intermediate frequencies and/or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. I argue that the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity-disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity-disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict. Disturbances and other environmental fluctuations can affect diversity, but for different reasons than are commonly recognized.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the therapeutic response and investigate the significance of polymorphic codons in African patients receiving highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).African patients were identified from the St Mary's Hospital HIV-1 database. Clinical outcome was assessed by viral load and CD4 cell count. Pre- and post-therapy sequences of RT and protease were analysed. The impact of subtype and individual polymorphic codons on therapeutic outcome was assessed statistically (Fishers exact and chi2 tests) and phylogenetically (Jukes and Cantor).Of 79 drug-naive African patients who were prescribed HAART, 60 remained undetectable for 1 year, with no differences detected in the clinical response to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- or protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimes. Country of origin, sex and viral subtype had no impact on outcome of HAART. A total of 133 polymorphisms were identified in pol (37 in protease and 96 in RT), with a mean of 9.0 in protease and 22.3 in RT per patient. There was no significant difference in the overall numbers of polymorphisms per patient, and no single polymorphism had any impact on clinical outcome. Sequences from 'failing' patients experiencing viral rebound produced few mutations known to be associated with drug resistance, suggesting minimal drug pressure.The response of patients infected with African subtypes of HIV-1 to HAART appears to be independent of regime, HIV-1 clade and baseline polymorphisms. Non-B subtypes are fully sensitive to HAART and, accordingly, therapy should not be withheld from African patients for reasons of viral diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {1RNA sequencing is a flexible and powerful new approach for measuring gene, exon, or isoform expression. To maximize the utility of RNA sequencing data, new statistical methods are needed for clustering, differential expression, and other analyses. A major barrier to the development of new statistical methods is the lack of RNA sequencing datasets that can be easily obtained and analyzed in common statistical software packages such as R. To speed up the development process, we have created a resource of analysis-ready RNA-sequencing datasets. 2ReCount is an online resource of RNA-seq gene count tables and auxilliary data. Tables were built from raw RNA sequencing data from 18 different published studies comprising 475 samples and over 8 billion reads. Using the Myrna package, reads were aligned, overlapped with gene models and tabulated into gene-by-sample count tables that are ready for statistical analysis. Count tables and phenotype data were combined into Bioconductor ExpressionSet objects for ease of analysis. ReCount also contains the Myrna manifest files and R source code used to process the samples, allowing statistical and computational scientists to consider alternative parameter values. 3By combining datasets from many studies and providing data that has already been processed from. fastq format into ready-to-use. RData and. txt files, ReCount facilitates analysis and methods development for RNA-seq count data. We anticipate that ReCount will also be useful for investigators who wish to consider cross-study comparisons and alternative normalization strategies for RNA-seq.},

  Abstract                 = {During infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), immune pressure from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) selects for viral mutants that confer escape from CTL recognition. These escape variants can be transmitted between individuals where, depending upon their cost to viral fitness and the CTL responses made by the recipient, they may revert. The rates of within-host evolution and their concordant impact upon the rate of spread of escape mutants at the population level are uncertain. Here we present a mathematical model of within-host evolution of escape mutants, transmission of these variants between hosts and subsequent reversion in new hosts. The model is an extension of the well-known SI model of disease transmission and includes three further parameters that describe host immunogenetic heterogeneity and rates of within host viral evolution. We use the model to explain why some escape mutants appear to have stable prevalence whilst others are spreading through the population. Further, we use it to compare diverse datasets on CTL escape, highlighting where different sources agree or disagree on within-host evolutionary rates. The several dozen CTL epitopes we survey from HIV-1 gag, RT and nef reveal a relatively sedate rate of evolution with average rates of escape measured in years and reversion in decades. For many epitopes in HIV, occasional rapid within-host evolution is not reflected in fast evolution at the population level.},

However, the search for one has been elusive despite more than 25 years of focused research.

We can draw several scientific and operational lessons from RV144 and other recent tests-of-concept efficacy trials. Here we describe how trial results, some unexpected, highlight the fundamental role these clinical studies play in HIV vaccine discovery. These trials also teach us that transparency in data analysis and results dissemination can yield substantial rewards and that efforts to engage communities, particularly those most heavily affected by the epidemic, are needed to augment research literacy and trial recruitment. Future efficacy trial designs may incorporate novel, partially effective prevention strategies. Although greater in size and complexity, these trials may offer unique opportunities to explore synergies with vaccines under study.},

  Abstract                 = {Malignant human embryonal carcinoma cells (ECCs) rely on similar transcriptional networks as non-malignant embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to control selfrenewal, maintain pluripotency, and inhibit differentiation. Because re-activation of silenced HERV-K(HML-2) loci is a hallmark of ECCs, we asked if this HERV group was also reactivated in ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).Using RT-PCR and Western Blot, we demonstrate HERV-K(HML-2) RNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human ESCs and iPSCs. Induction of differentiation by embryoid body formation resulted in rapid silencing of HERV-K(HML-2) provirus expression. Sequencing analysis of a conserved region of the gag gene showed that proviral expression in ESCs and iPSCs represents at least 11 of the 66 nearly full length HERV-K(HML-2) loci, with slightly varying patterns in individual cell lines. These proviruses are human specific integrations and harbor promoter competent long terminal repeats (LTR5hs subgroup). We observed high mRNA levels of the NP9 and Gag encoding proviruses K101(22q11.21) in all and K10(5q33.3) in most of the ECC, ESC, and iPSC lines tested, while K37(11q23.3) mRNA was detected only in ESCs and iPSCs. In addition, we detected expression of proviral mRNA encoding the RNA export adaptor Rec in all cell lines studied. Proviral mRNA originating from the K108(7p22.1) locus, which inter alia codes for functional Rec and Env proteins, was only reactivated in malignant ECC lines, not in benign ESCs or iPSCs.HERV-K(HML-2) RNA and protein expression is a marker for pluripotent human stem cells. Initiation of differentiation results in rapid down-regulation. Further studies are needed to explore a putative functional role of HERV-K(HML-2) RNA and proteins in pluripotent stem cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Virus derived from an infectious molecular clone of the ELI strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replicates well in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in some CD4-positive cell lines but exhibits a delayed time course of infection in CEM and H9 cells and fails to infect SupT1 and U937 cells. If the virus that emerges from infected H9 cells is used to infect CEM and H9 cells, the time course of infection is accelerated and the virus is able to infect U937 and SupT1 cells. In this study, we used the technique of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism to localize changes in both the extracellular gp120 and the transmembrane gp41 components of the envelope gene associated with adaptation to growth in tissue culture cell lines. Specifically, mutations were identified both in a region of gp120 implicated in CD4 binding and in the amino-terminal portion of gp41 adjacent to the region involved in fusion. No changes were found in the V3 loop of gp120, a region previously shown to be involved in viral tropism. When these mutations were introduced into the original molecular clone, they conferred an enhanced replicative capacity on ELI. These results demonstrate that two additional determinants in the HIV-1 envelope protein influence viral tropism and growth in vitro. They also may have important implications for the generation of viruses with increased growth potential and expanded host range seen in the late stages of HIV disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the viral genome is often quite small, it encodes a broad series of proteins. The virus takes advantage of the host-RNA-processing machinery to provide the alternative splicing capability necessary for the expression of this proteomic diversity. Serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins and the kinases that activate them are central to this alternative splicing machinery. In studies reported here, we use the HIV genome as a model. We show that HIV expression decreases overall SR protein/activity. However, we also show that HIV expression is significantly increased (20-fold) when one of the SR proteins, SRp75 is phosphorylated by SR protein kinase (SRPK)2. Thus, inhibitors of SRPK2 and perhaps of functionally related kinases, such as SRPK1, could be useful antiviral agents. Here, we develop this hypothesis and show that HIV expression down-regulates SR proteins in Flp-In293 cells, resulting in only low-level HIV expression in these cells. However, increasing SRPK2 function up-regulates HIV expression. In addition, we introduce SR protein phosphorylation inhibitor 340 (SRPIN340), which preferentially inhibits SRPK1 and SRPK2 and down-regulates SRp75. Although an isonicotinamide compound, SPRIN340 (or its derivatives) remain to be optimized for better specificity and lower cytotoxicity, we show here that SRPIN340 suppresses propagation of Sindbis virus in plaque assay and variably suppresses HIV production. Thus, we show that SRPK, a well known kinase in the cellular RNA-processing machinery, is used by at least some viruses for propagation and hence suggest that SRPIN340 or its derivatives may be useful for curbing viral diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that superinfection of HIV positive individuals with heterologous HIV strains could lead to faster progression to AIDS, generating concern over the risks of exposure to new infections in those already infected.A mathematical model of the within-host dynamics of two sequential infections with strains of HIV describing activation and infection of immune cells was developed. Multiple stochastic realizations describing progression to AIDS in the individual were generated, comparing the situation with and without superinfection.It was found that the susceptibility of immune cells to dual infection is crucial to the outcome of HIV superinfection. A low susceptibility leads to competitive exclusion between the strains and a high susceptibility may lead to co-existence if the superinfecting strain is sufficiently fit. It was also found that only superinfection with a fitter strain leads to faster progression to AIDS, rather than superinfection per se.In theory, a superinfection event with a heterologous strain of HIV does not lead to faster progression to AIDS. Unless superinfection allows the spread of fitter virus, it should not be of concern for public health.},

  Abstract                 = {A polymerase chain reaction-based analysis was used to define the structures of the mRNAs that encode human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) regulatory and structural proteins in infected H9 cells. Twenty alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding the vif, vpr, env, nef, tat, and rev proteins were characterized. An evaluation of the coding potentials of these transcripts recognized both leaky scanning and reinitiation at downstream initiation codons as mechanisms that may operate during translation of many of the polycistronic messages. Two new splice acceptor sites, one at nt 6018 defining a new mRNA coding for the env and vpu proteins and another at nt 8671 defining a novel tat-env fusion transcript, were characterized. The latter transcript expressed a novel protein p17tev that was immunoprecipitated by both polyclonal tat antibodies and monoclonals directed towards the C-terminal region of gp41. The p17tev protein was able to transactivate transcription from the HIV-1 LTR in transient transfection assays. The use of multiple alternative splice donor and acceptor sites and the generation of novel proteins may confer evolutionary advantages on the viral mutants encoding them and influence the course of clinical disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Nevirapine forms the mainstay of our efforts to curtail the pediatric AIDS epidemic through prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. A key limitation, however, is the rapid selection of HIV-1 strains resistant to nevirapine following the administration of a single dose. This rapid selection of resistance suggests that nevirapine-resistant strains preexist in HIV-1 patients and may adversely affect outcomes of treatment. The frequencies of nevirapine-resistant strains in vivo, however, remain poorly estimated, possibly because they exist as a minority below current assay detection limits. Here, we employ stochastic simulations and a mathematical model to estimate the frequencies of strains carrying different combinations of the common nevirapine resistance mutations K103N, V106A, Y181C, Y188C, and G190A in chronically infected HIV-1 patients naïve to nevirapine. We estimate the relative fitness of mutant strains from an independent analysis of previous competitive growth assays. We predict that single mutants are likely to preexist in patients at frequencies ( approximately 0.01\% to 0.001\%) near or below current assay detection limits (>0.01\%), emphasizing the need for more-sensitive assays. The existence of double mutants is subject to large stochastic variations. Triple and higher mutants are predicted not to exist. Our estimates are robust to variations in the recombination rate, cellular superinfection frequency, and the effective population size. Thus, with 10(7) to 10(8) infected cells in HIV-1 patients, even when undetected, nevirapine-resistant genomes may exist in substantial numbers and compromise efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1, accelerate the failure of subsequent antiretroviral treatments, and facilitate the transmission of drug resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine accuracy of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibody testing system using a device to collect and stabilize oral mucosal transudate (OMT), a fluid with increased levels of IgG; an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening test optimized for OMT; and a Western blot confirmatory test designed for use with OMT.The OMT specimens were tested by EIA and, if indicated, confirmatory Western blot according to a standard testing algorithm. The OMT results were compared with true HIV status as determined by serum testing and/or clinical diagnosis.Specimens from 3570 subjects (2382 at low risk, 698 at high risk, 242 with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], and 248 "nonspecificity" [persons with diseases associated with an increased frequency of false-positive results in HIV testing]) were collected at 11 geographically diverse sites (including blood banks, public health clinics, general medical clinics, HIV clinics, sexually transmitted disease clinics, and a hemophilia center) in the United States.Overall accuracy of testing OMT for HIV-1 antibodies compared with true HIV-1 antibody status; sensitivity and specificity of OMT EIA and Western blot.Sensitivity of OMT EIA testing in 673 true-positive subjects was 99.9\% (672/673). The OMT Western blot results in the 673 true-positive subjects were positive in 665 and indeterminate in 8. The EIA followed by Western blot (if EIA was repeatedly reactive) yielded a negative result in 99.9\% (2893/2897) of OMT samples from true negatives and an indeterminate result in 4. The OMT testing system provided the correct result or would trigger appropriate follow-up testing in 3569 (>99.9\%) of 3570 cases.HIV-1 antibody testing of OMT samples is a highly accurate alternative to serum testing.},

No HTLV-III was detected in or isolated from 115 normal heterosexual subjects. The number of HTLV-III isolates reported here underestimates the true prevalence of the virus since many specimens were received in unsatisfactory condition. Other data show that serum samples from a high proportion of AIDS patients contain antibodies to HTLV-III. That these new isolates are members of the HTLV family but differ from the previous isolates known as HTLV-I and HTLV-II is indicated by their morphological, biological, and immunological characteristics. These results and those reported elsewhere in this issue suggest that HTLV-III may be the primary cause of AIDS.},

The T-cell tropism of HTLV and its prevalence in the Caribbean basin prompted a search for it in patients with the epidemic T-cell immune deficiency disorder known as AIDS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient in the United States and two in France were cultured with T-cell growth factor (TCGF) an shown to express HTLV antigens. Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown to be related to HTLV subgroup I. The virus was also transmitted into normal human T cells from umbilical cord blood of a newborn. Whether or not HTLV-I or other retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it to others. If the target cell of AIDS is the mature T cell as suspected, the methods used in these studies may prove useful for the long-term growth of these cells and for the identification of antigens specific for the etiological agent of AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 capsid protein forms the conical core structure at the center of the mature virion. Capsid also binds the human peptidyl prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin A, thereby packaging the enzyme into the virion. Cyclophilin A subsequently performs an essential function in HIV-1 replication, possibly helping to disassemble the capsid core upon infection. We report the 2.36 A crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid (residues 1-151) in complex with human cyclophilin A. A single exposed capsid loop (residues 85-93) binds in the enzyme's active site, and Pro-90 adopts an unprecedented trans conformation. The structure suggests how cyclophilin A can act as a sequence-specific binding protein and a nonspecific prolyl isomerase. In the crystal lattice, capsid molecules assemble into continuous planar strips. Side by side association of these strips may allow capsid to form the surface of the viral core. Cyclophilin A could then function by weakening the association between capsid strips, thereby promoting disassembly of the viral core.},

  Abstract                 = {The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is packaged within an unusual conical core particle located at the center of the infectious virion. The core is composed of a complex of the NC (nucleocapsid) protein and genomic RNA, surrounded by a shell of the CA (capsid) protein. A method was developed for assembling cones in vitro using pure recombinant HIV-1 CA-NC fusion proteins and RNA templates. These synthetic cores are capped at both ends and appear similar in size and morphology to authentic viral cores. It is proposed that both viral and synthetic cores are organized on conical hexagonal lattices, which by Euler's theorem requires quantization of their cone angles. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that the cone angles of synthetic cores were indeed quantized into the five allowed angles. The viral core and most synthetic cones exhibited cone angles of approximately 19 degrees (the narrowest of the allowed angles). These observations suggest that the core of HIV is organized on the principles of a fullerene cone, in analogy to structures recently observed for elemental carbon.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, or HIV) often evades cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses by generating variants that are not recognized by CTLs. We used single genome amplification and sequencing of complete HIV genomes to identify longitudinal changes in the transmitted/founder virus from the establishment of infection to the viral set-point at 1 year after the infection. We found that the rate of viral escape from CTL responses in a given patient decreases dramatically from the acute infection to the viral set point. Using a novel mathematical model that tracks the dynamics of viral escape at multiple epitopes we show that a number of factors could potentially contribute to a slower escape in the chronic phase of infection, such as a decreased magnitude of epitope-specific CTL responses, an increased fitness cost of escape mutations, or an increased diversity of the CTL response. In the model, an increase in the number of epitope-specific CTL responses can reduce the rate of viral escape from a given epitope-specific CTL response, particularly if CD8(+) T cells compete for killing of infected cells or control virus replication non-lytically. Our mathematical framework of viral escape from multiple CTL responses can be used to predict the breadth and magnitude of HIV-specific CTL response that needs to be induced by vaccination to reduce (or even prevent) viral escape following HIV infection.},

Here we show that HIV infection activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) to produce cGAMP, which binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING to induce type I interferons and other cytokines. Inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase, but not integrase, abrogated interferon-β induction by the virus, suggesting that the reverse-transcribed HIV DNA triggers the innate immune response. Knockout or knockdown of cGAS in mouse or human cell lines blocked cytokine induction by HIV, murine leukemia virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus. These results indicate that cGAS is an innate immune sensor of HIV and other retroviruses.},

  Abstract                 = {The human AIDS viruses human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) represent cross-species (zoonotic) infections. Although the primate reservoir of HIV-2 has been clearly identified as the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), the origin of HIV-1 remains uncertain. Viruses related to HIV-1 have been isolated from the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), but only three such SIVcpz infections have been documented, one of which involved a virus so divergent that it might represent a different primate lentiviral lineage. In a search for the HIV-1 reservoir, we have now sequenced the genome of a new SIVcpzstrain (SIVcpzUS) and have determined, by mitochondrial DNA analysis, the subspecies identity of all known SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. We find that two chimpanzee subspecies in Africa, the central P. t. troglodytes and the eastern P. t. schweinfurthii, harbour SIVcpz and that their respective viruses form two highly divergent (but subspecies-specific) phylogenetic lineages. All HIV-1 strains known to infect man, including HIV-1 groups M, N and O, are closely related to just one of these SIVcpz lineages, that found in P. t. troglodytes. Moreover, we find that HIV-1 group N is a mosaic of SIVcpzUS- and HIV-1-related sequences, indicating an ancestral recombination event in a chimpanzee host. These results, together with the observation that the natural range of P. t. troglodytes coincides uniquely with areas of HIV-1 group M, N and O endemicity, indicate that P. t. troglodytes is the primary reservoir for HIV-1 and has been the source of at least three independent introductions of SIVcpz into the human population.},

  Abstract                 = {A decline in the T-cell population usually marks the onset of progressive immunological disease in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because CD4+ cells help to coordinate efficient immune responses, some of the defects in the immune function in advanced cases of AIDS may be explained by the disappearance of these cells. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms used by HIV to induce the reduction of CD4+ cells is important. Here we use a Moloney murine leukaemia virus-based retroviral vector in order to express the nef gene of HIV-1 in three lymphocytic cell lines expressing CD4. In all cases we find that cell-surface CD4 expression is inversely related to nef expression. However, nef does not alter steady-state levels of CD4 RNA or CD4 protein. Also, nef can downregulate a CD4 triple mutant (Ser----Ala) that is neither phosphorylated nor down-regulated by phorbol esters, indicating that nef is acting by a different mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) rapidly degrades both mutated mRNAs and nonmutated cellular mRNAs in what is thought to be a constitutive fashion. Here we demonstrate that NMD is inhibited in hypoxic cells and that this inhibition is dependent on phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). eIF2alpha phosphorylation is known to promote translational and transcriptional up-regulation of genes important for the cellular response to stress. We show that the mRNAs of several of these stress-induced genes are NMD targets and that the repression of NMD stabilizes these mRNAs, thus demonstrating that the inhibition of NMD augments the cellular stress response. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced formation of cytoplasmic stress granules is also dependent on eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and components of the NMD pathway are relocalized to these granules in hypoxic cells, providing a potential mechanism for the hypoxic inhibition of NMD. Our demonstration that NMD is inhibited in hypoxic cells reveals that the regulation of NMD can dynamically alter gene expression and also establishes a novel mechanism for hypoxic gene regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient infectious agents that have integrated into the human genome. Under normal circumstances, HERVs are functionally defective or controlled by host factors. In HIV-1-infected individuals, intracellular defense mechanisms are compromised. We hypothesized that HIV-1 infection would remove or alter controls on HERV activity. Expression of HERV could potentially stimulate a T cell response to HERV antigens, and in regions of HIV-1/HERV similarity, these T cells could be cross-reactive. We determined that the levels of HERV production in HIV-1-positive individuals exceed those of HIV-1-negative controls. To investigate the impact of HERV activity on specific immunity, we examined T cell responses to HERV peptides in 29 HIV-1-positive and 13 HIV-1-negative study participants. We report T cell responses to peptides derived from regions of HERV detected by ELISPOT analysis in the HIV-1-positive study participants. We show an inverse correlation between anti-HERV T cell responses and HIV-1 plasma viral load. In HIV-1-positive individuals, we demonstrate that HERV-specific T cells are capable of killing cells presenting their cognate peptide. These data indicate that HIV-1 infection leads to HERV expression and stimulation of a HERV-specific CD8+ T cell response. HERV-specific CD8+ T cells have characteristics consistent with an important role in the response to HIV-1 infection: a phenotype similar to that of T cells responding to an effectively controlled virus (cytomegalovirus), an inverse correlation with HIV-1 plasma viral load, and the ability to lyse cells presenting their target peptide. These characteristics suggest that elicitation of anti-HERV-specific immune responses is a novel approach to immunotherapeutic vaccination. As endogenous retroviral sequences are fixed in the human genome, they provide a stable target, and HERV-specific T cells could recognize a cell infected by any HIV-1 viral variant. HERV-specific immunity is an important new avenue for investigation in HIV-1 pathogenesis and vaccine design.},

Previously, we reported the case study of a 15-year-old black male who was admitted to St Louis City Hospital in 1968 for extensive lymphedema of the genitalia and lower extremities. Chlamydial organisms were widely disseminated and isolated from numerous body fluids and organs. Over a 16-month clinical course his condition progressively deteriorated, and at autopsy there was widespread Kaposi's sarcoma of the aggressive, disseminated type. Recently performed Western blot and antigen capture assays on serum and autopsy tissue specimens frozen since 1969 have disclosed that this sexually active teenager was infected with a virus closely related or identical to human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The clinical and immunologic findings together suggest that an immunosuppressive retrovirus existed in the United States before the late 1970s.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent reports indicate that NAD(P)H oxidase 1 (Nox1) mRNA undergoes alternative splicing, producing a short transcript (NOH-1S) encoding a novel H+ channel. Although the H+ transport properties of NOH-1S-transfected cells resemble those of many cells, the production of a NOH-1S protein was never documented. We characterized Nox1 transcripts in colon-derived cells and present evidence that mRNA splicing does not produce NOH-1S; rather, NOH-1S appears to be an artifact of template switching during cDNA synthesis. The NOH-1S transcript was not observed by Northern blotting, despite claims of its abundance based on RNase protection assays. The shortened cDNA was generated by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, but not by thermally stable reverse transcriptase under conditions that produce full-length Nox1. Analysis of shortened cDNAs detected NOH-1S sequence and other variants that differ at the alleged splice junction site. Although no appropriate RNA splicing sites were found within Nox1 to account for NOH-1S formation, we found repetitive sequence elements bordering the deleted region, which could promote intramolecular template switching during cDNA synthesis. Template switching was confirmed in vitro, where the deleted cDNA was generated by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase from a synthetic, full-length Nox1 RNA template. A survey of the expressed sequence tags database suggests that similar switching phenomena occur between repetitive elements in other Nox family transcripts, indicating such cloning artifacts are common. In contrast, genuine RNA splicing does account for another Nox1 transcript lacking the entire exon 11, which is abundant in colon cells but encodes a protein incapable of supporting superoxide production.},

  Abstract                 = {The National Institutes of Health's Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project was designed to generate and sequence a publicly accessible cDNA resource containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) for every human and mouse gene. The project initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5'-EST sequences, and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms developed for this project. Currently, more than 11,000 human and 10,000 mouse genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the project, and ongoing frog (Xenopus) and zebrafish (Danio) cDNA projects were expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.},

One patient died of a Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

Two patients were sexual partners and three had never been to the USA, where cases of severe acquired immunodeficiency have been reported.

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Cancer is an evolutionary process characterized by accumulating mutations. However, the precise timing and the order of genetic alterations that drive tumor progression remain enigmatic. RESULTS: We present a specific probabilistic graphical model for the accumulation of mutations and their interdependencies. The Bayesian network models cancer progression by an explicit unobservable accumulation process in time that is separated from the observable but error-prone detection of mutations. Model parameters are estimated by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the underlying interaction graph is obtained by a simulated annealing procedure. Applying this method to cytogenetic data for different cancer types, we find multiple complex oncogenetic pathways deviating substantially from simplified models, such as linear pathways or trees. We further demonstrate how the inferred progression dynamics can be used to improve genetics-based survival predictions which could support diagnostics and prognosis.

The emergence of pandemic HIV type-1 (HIV-1) infection during the late 20th century shaped a view of lentiviruses as 'modern' viruses. However, recent research has revealed an entirely different perspective, elucidating aspects of an evolutionary relationship with mammals that extends across many millions of years. Such deep evolutionary history is likely to be typical of many host-virus systems, fundamentally underpinning their interactions in the present day. For this reason, establishing the deep history of virus and host interaction is key to developing a fully informed approach to tackling viral diseases. Here, I use the example of lentiviruses to illustrate how paleovirological, geographic and genetic calibrations allow observations of virus and host interaction across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales to be integrated into a coherent ecological and evolutionary framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Lentiviruses chronically infect a broad range of mammalian species and have been transmitted from primates to humans, giving rise to multiple outbreaks of HIV infection over the past century. Although the circumstances surrounding these recent zoonoses are becoming clearer, the nature and timescale of interaction between lentiviruses and primates remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of an endogenous lentivirus in the genome of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a strepsirrhine primate from Madagascar, demonstrating that lentiviruses are capable of invading the primate germ line. Phylogenetic analysis places gray mouse lemur prosimian immunodeficiency virus (pSIVgml) basal to all known primate lentiviruses and, consistent with this, its genomic organization is intermediate between the nonprimate lentiviruses and their more derived primate counterparts. Thus, pSIVgml represents the first unambiguous example of a viral transitional form, revealing the acquisition and loss of genomic features during lentiviral evolution. Furthermore, because terrestrial mammal populations in Madagascar and Africa are likely to have been isolated from one another for at least 14 million years, the presence of pSIVgml in the gray mouse lemur genome indicates that lentiviruses must have been infecting primates for at least this period of time, or have been transmitted between Malagasy and African primate populations by a vector species capable of traversing the Mozambique channel. The discovery of pSIVgml illustrates the utility of endogenous sequences for the study of contemporary retroviruses and indicates that primate lentiviruses may be considerably older and more broadly distributed than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {Because most extant viruses mutate rapidly and lack a true fossil record, their deep evolution and long-term substitution rates remain poorly understood. In addition to retroviruses, which rely on chromosomal integration for their replication, many other viruses replicate in the nucleus of their host's cells and are therefore prone to endogenization, a process that involves integration of viral DNA into the host's germline genome followed by long-term vertical inheritance. Such endogenous viruses are highly valuable as they provide a molecular fossil record of past viral invasions, which may be used to decipher the origins and long-term evolutionary characteristics of modern pathogenic viruses. Hepadnaviruses (Hepadnaviridae) are a family of small, partially double-stranded DNA viruses that include hepatitis B viruses. Here we report the discovery of endogenous hepadnaviruses in the genome of the zebra finch. We used a combination of cross-species analysis of orthologous insertions, molecular dating, and phylogenetic analyses to demonstrate that hepadnaviruses infiltrated repeatedly the germline genome of passerine birds. We provide evidence that some of the avian hepadnavirus integration events are at least 19 My old, which reveals a much deeper ancestry of Hepadnaviridae than could be inferred based on the coalescence times of modern hepadnaviruses. Furthermore, the remarkable sequence similarity between endogenous and extant avian hepadnaviruses (up to 75\% identity) suggests that long-term substitution rates for these viruses are on the order of 10(-8) substitutions per site per year, which is a 1,000-fold slower than short-term rates estimated based on the sequences of circulating hepadnaviruses. Together, these results imply a drastic shift in our understanding of the time scale of hepadnavirus evolution, and suggest that the rapid evolutionary dynamics characterizing modern avian hepadnaviruses do not reflect their mode of evolution on a deep time scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Retroviruses normally infect the somatic cells of their host and are transmitted horizontally, i.e., in an exogenous way. Occasionally, however, some retroviruses can also infect and integrate into the genome of germ cells, which may allow for their vertical inheritance and fixation in a given species; a process known as endogenization. Lentiviruses, a group of mammalian retroviruses that includes HIV, are known to infect primates, ruminants, horses, and cats. Unlike many other retroviruses, these viruses have not been demonstrably successful at germline infiltration. Here, we report on the discovery of endogenous lentiviral insertions in seven species of Malagasy lemurs from two different genera -- Cheirogaleus and Microcebus. Combining molecular clock analyses and cross-species screening of orthologous insertions, we show that the presence of this endogenous lentivirus in six species of Microcebus is the result of one endogenization event that occurred about 4.2 million years ago. In addition, we demonstrate that this lentivirus independently infiltrated the germline of Cheirogaleus and that the two endogenization events occurred quasi-simultaneously. Using multiple proviral copies, we derive and characterize an apparently full length and intact consensus for this lentivirus. These results provide evidence that lentiviruses have repeatedly infiltrated the germline of prosimian species and that primates have been exposed to lentiviruses for a much longer time than what can be inferred based on sequence comparison of circulating lentiviruses. The study sets the stage for an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct an ancestral primate lentivirus and thereby advance our knowledge of host-virus interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 group M subtype B was the first HIV discovered and is the predominant variant of AIDS virus in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the circumstances of its origin and emergence remain unresolved. Here we propose a geographic sequence and time line for the origin of subtype B and the emergence of pandemic HIV/AIDS out of Africa. Using HIV-1 gene sequences recovered from archival samples from some of the earliest known Haitian AIDS patients, we find that subtype B likely moved from Africa to Haiti in or around 1966 (1962-1970) and then spread there for some years before successfully dispersing elsewhere. A "pandemic" clade, encompassing the vast majority of non-Haitian subtype B infections in the United States and elsewhere around the world, subsequently emerged after a single migration of the virus out of Haiti in or around 1969 (1966-1972). Haiti appears to have the oldest HIV/AIDS epidemic outside sub-Saharan Africa and the most genetically diverse subtype B epidemic, which might present challenges for HIV-1 vaccine design and testing. The emergence of the pandemic variant of subtype B was an important turning point in the history of AIDS, but its spread was likely driven by ecological rather than evolutionary factors. Our results suggest that HIV-1 circulated cryptically in the United States for approximately 12 years before the recognition of AIDS in 1981.},

The model includes a number of novel features for which experimental evidence is presented. First, growing minus DNA strand is copied from the viral RNA only up to a position about 150 nucleotides from the 5' end of the RNA. Second, plus-strand DNA, after being copied from approximately 600 nucleotides at the 5' end of the minus-strand DNA, then transcribes the first approximately 20 nucleotides of the tRNApro primer (which is covalently attaced to the 5' end of the minus DNA strand). The 3' ends of the minus and plus DNA probably form a hybrid through the homology conferred by the primer binding site sequences. Third, the minus and plus DNA strands are elongated in a continuous fashion resulting in a linear double-stranded DNA molecule containing a 600 nucleotide direct repeat at both ends. The most of the features of the model have experimental support, and it appears to provide a credible description of reverse transcription.},

  Abstract                 = {The architecture of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome presents an intriguing dilemma for the 3' processing of viral transcripts--to disregard a canonical 'core' poly(A) site processing signal present at the 5' end of the transcript and yet to utilize efficiently an identical signal that resides at the 3' end of the message. The choice of processing sites in HIV-1 appears to be influenced by two factors: (i) proximity to the cap site, and (ii) sequences upstream of the core poly(A) site. We now demonstrate that an in vivo-defined upstream element that resides within the U3 region, 76 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA hexamer, acts specifically to enhance 3' processing at the HIV-1 core poly(A) site in vitro. We furthermore show that efficient in vitro 3' processing requires the RNA stem-loop structure of TAR, which serves to juxtapose spatially the upstream element and the core poly(A) site. An analysis of the stability of 3' processing complexes formed at the HIV-1 poly(A) site in vitro suggests that the upstream element may function by increasing processing complex stability at the core poly(A) site.},

We observed a rapid accumulation of interhost and intrahost genetic variation, allowing us to characterize patterns of viral transmission over the initial weeks of the epidemic. This West African variant likely diverged from central African lineages around 2004, crossed from Guinea to Sierra Leone in May 2014, and has exhibited sustained human-to-human transmission subsequently, with no evidence of additional zoonotic sources. Because many of the mutations alter protein sequences and other biologically meaningful targets, they should be monitored for impact on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response.},

Results to date address advances on gene modulation associated with immune dysregulation, susceptibility to apoptosis, virus replication, and viral persistence following in vitro or in vivo infection/exposure to HIV-1 virus or HIV-1 accessory proteins. In addition to gene modulation associated with known functional correlates of HIV infection and replication (e.g., T cell apoptosis), microarray data have yielded novel, potential mechanisms of HIV-mediated pathogenesis such as modulation of cholesterol biosynthetic genes in CD4 T cells (relevant to virus replication and infectivity) and modulation of proteasomes and histone deacetylases in chronically infected cell lines (relevant to virus latency). Intrinsic challenges in summarizing gene modulation studies remain in development of sound approaches for comparing data obtained using different platforms and analytical tools, deriving unifying concepts to distil the large volumes of data collected, and the necessity to impose a focus for validation on a small fraction of genes. Notwithstanding these challenges, the field overall continues to demonstrate progress in expanding the pool of target genes validated to date in in vitro and in vivo datasets and understanding the functional correlates of gene modulation to HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo.},

So far in Spain, Maedi visna virus-like (MVV-like) sequences have been found in both species, and the arthritic SRLV disease has never been found in sheep until a recent outbreak. Knowing that arthritis is common in goats, it was of interest to determine if the genetic type of the virus involved in the sheep arthritis outbreak was caprine arthritis encephalitis virus-like (CAEV-like) rather than MVV-like. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences from SRLV of this outbreak, allowed a B2 genetic subgroup assignment of these SRLV, compatible with a correspondence between the virus genetic type and the disease form. Furthermore, an isolate was obtained from the arthritic outbreak, its full genome was CAEV-like but the pol integrase region was MVV-like. Although its LTR lacked a U3 repeat sequence and had a deletion in the R region, which has been proposed to reduce viral replication rate, its phenotype in sheep skin fibroblast cultures was rapid/high, thus it appeared to have adapted to sheep cells. This outbreak study represents the first report on CAEV-like genetic findings and complete genome analysis among Spanish small ruminants.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a protein, called Vpr, that prevents proliferation of infected cells by arresting them in G2 of the cell cycle. This Vpr-mediated cell-cycle arrest is also conserved among highly divergent simian immunodeficiency viruses, suggesting an important role in the virus life cycle. However, it has been unclear how this could be a selective advantage for the virus. Here we provide evidence that expression of the viral genome is optimal in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and that Vpr increases virus production by delaying cells at the point of the cell cycle where the long terminal repeat (LTR) is most active. Although Vpr is selected against when virus is adapted to tissue culture, we show that selection for Vpr function in vivo occurs in both humans and chimpanzees infected with HIV-1. These results suggest a novel mechanism for maximizing virus production in the face of rapid killing of infected target cells.},

The superinfecting strain rapidly became the predominant population virus, suggesting that the initial and superinfecting viruses in this individual differed in virulence. However, we found no molecular epidemiological evidence in the HIV database to suggest that this strain had been found in other individuals. In addition, this subject's HIV-1 viral load and pattern of human leukocyte antigen and coreceptor polymorphisms only partially explained his rapid disease progression.Additional studies are needed to determine whether superinfection itself and/or infection with a dual-tropic virus causes rapid disease progression, or whether certain individuals who are innately more susceptible to rapid disease progression also lack the ability to resist the challenge of a second infection.

  Abstract                 = {Four previously healthy homosexual men contracted Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, extensive mucosal candidiasis, and multiple viral infections. In three of the patients these infections followed prolonged fevers of unknown origin. In all four cytomegalovirus was recovered from secretions. Kaposi's sarcoma developed in one patient eight months after he presented with esophageal candidiasis. All patients were anergic and lymphopenic; they had no lymphocyte proliferative responses to soluble antigens, and their responses to phytohemagglutinin were markedly reduced. Monoclonal-antibody analysis of peripheral-blood T-cell subpopulations revealed virtual elimination of the Leu-3 / helper/inducer subset, an increased percentage of the Leu-2 + suppressor/cytoxic subset, and an increased percentage of cells bearing the thymocyte-associated antigen T10. The inversion of the T/ helper to suppressor/cytotoxic ratio suggested that cytomegalovirus infection was an important factor in the pathogenesis of the immunodeficient state. A high level of exposure of male homosexuals to cytomegalovirus-infected secretions may account for the occurrence of this immune deficiency.},

This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which HIV manipulates the apoptotic machinery to its advantage, assesses the functional consequences of this process and evaluates how new therapeutics might counteract this strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously.We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability.The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM).ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu; epierce@mail.med.upenn.eduThe RNA-Seq sequence reads described in the article are deposited at GEO, accession GSE26248.},

The answer must lie within their proteomes. It is becoming clear that alternative splicing has an extremely important role in expanding protein diversity and might therefore partially underlie the apparent discrepancy between gene number and organismal complexity. Alternative splicing can generate more transcripts from a single gene than the number of genes in an entire genome. However, for the vast majority of alternative splicing events, the functional significance is unknown. Developing a full catalog of alternatively spliced transcripts and determining each of their functions will be a major challenge of the upcoming proteomic era.},

  Abstract                 = {Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most well studied genetic model organisms; nonetheless, its genome still contains unannotated coding and non-coding genes, transcripts, exons and RNA editing sites. Full discovery and annotation are pre-requisites for understanding how the regulation of transcription, splicing and RNA editing directs the development of this complex organism. Here we used RNA-Seq, tiling microarrays and cDNA sequencing to explore the transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages. We identified 111,195 new elements, including thousands of genes, coding and non-coding transcripts, exons, splicing and editing events, and inferred protein isoforms that previously eluded discovery using established experimental, prediction and conservation-based approaches. These data substantially expand the number of known transcribed elements in the Drosophila genome and provide a high-resolution view of transcriptome dynamics throughout development.},

A number of sequencing groups are in the process of scaling up their throughput; over the next few years they will need to attain a collective capacity approaching half a gigabase per year to complete the 3-Gb genome sequence by the target date of 2005. At present, all contributing groups are using a clone-by-clone approach, in which mapped bacterial clones (typically 40–400 kb in size) from known chromosomal locations are sequenced to completion. Among other advantages, this permits a variety of alternative sequencing strategies and methods to be explored independently without redundancy of effort. Although it is not too late to consider implementing a different approach, any such approach must have as high a probability of success as the current one and offer significant advantages (such as decreased cost). I argue here that the whole-genome shotgun proposed by Weber and Myers satisfies neither condition.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcriptional interference between adjacent genes has been demonstrated in a variety of biological systems. To study this process in RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribed genes we have analysed the effect of transcription on tandem HIV-1 promoters integrated into the genome of HeLa cells. We show that transcriptional activation at the upstream promoter reduces transcription from the downstream promoter, as compared with basal transcription conditions (in the absence of an activator). Furthermore, insertion of a strong transcriptional termination element between the two promoters alleviates this transcriptional interference, resulting in elevated levels of transcription from the downstream promoter. Actual protein interactions with the downstream (occluded) promoter were analysed by in vivo footprinting. Binding of Sp1 transcription factors to the occluded promoter was reduced, when compared with the footprint pattern of the promoter protected by the terminator. This suggests that promoter occlusion is due to disruption of certain transcription factors and that it can be blocked by an intervening transcriptional terminator. Chromatin mapping with DNase I indicates that a factor binds to the termination element under both basal and induced conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), also known as jaagsiekte, is a transmissible lung tumour of sheep caused by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV). JSRV induces neoplastic transformation of alveolar and bronchiolar secretory epithelial cells and the resulting tumours can grow to occupy a significant portion of the lung. Tumour growth is frequently accompanied by the overproduction of fluid in the lung, which further compromises normal respiration. The period between infection and the appearance of clinical signs may be several months or years and many JSRV-infected sheep do not exhibit clinical signs at all during their lifespan. This allows the spread of OPA into new flocks through contact with infected but apparently normal animals. OPA was first described in the early 19th century; however, it has still not been possible to devise effective methods for controlling its spread and it remains an important problem in most countries where sheep are farmed. This is due in part to the absence of an immunological response to JSRV in infected animals, which has hindered the development of serological diagnostic tests and vaccines. In addition to its veterinary importance, OPA is regarded as a potential large animal model for human lung adenocarcinoma and this has stimulated research into the pathogenesis of the ovine disease. This work has produced some significant results, including the finding that one of the JSRV structural proteins is directly involved in oncogenesis. The recent advances in understanding JSRV and the pathogenesis of OPA should lead to novel strategies for diagnosis and control of this disease and for its exploitation as a comparative model for human lung cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {The alternative splicing code that controls and coordinates the transcriptome in complex multicellular organisms remains poorly understood. It has long been argued that regulation of alternative splicing relies on combinatorial interactions between multiple proteins, and that tissue-specific splicing decisions most likely result from differences in the concentration and/or activity of these proteins. However, large-scale data to systematically address this issue have just recently started to become available. Here we show that splicing factor gene expression signatures can be identified that reflect cell type and tissue-specific patterns of alternative splicing. We used a computational approach to analyze microarray-based gene expression profiles of splicing factors from mouse, chimpanzee and human tissues. Our results show that brain and testis, the two tissues with highest levels of alternative splicing events, have the largest number of splicing factor genes that are most highly differentially expressed. We further identified SR protein kinases and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) proteins among the splicing factor genes that are most highly differentially expressed in a particular tissue. These results indicate the power of generating signature-based predictions as an initial computational approach into a global view of tissue-specific alternative splicing regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections, and comprise nearly 8\% of the human genome. The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor. Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins. However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development.},

  Abstract                 = {The utilization of alternative splice acceptors for excision of the 5' major intron of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA was observed after infection in vitro. Specific splice events were monitored by a cDNA-polymerase chain reaction. These splice events shared a common splice donor but utilized several alternative splice acceptors. In addition to identifying the previously documented splice acceptors for tat and nef (S. K. Arya, C. Guo, S. F. Josephs, and F. Wong-Staal, Science 229:69-73, 1985), nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA-polymerase chain reaction fragments also revealed the following: (i) two splice acceptors 15 and 9 nucleotides upstream from the rev start codon, which are utilized to create transcripts suitable for specific rev expression; and (ii) use of the splice acceptor previously attributed to nef to generate a singly spliced, env-encoding transcript. Hybridization signals representing the nef/env, tat, and rev splice events increased in intensity between 6 and 12 h after infection of CEM cells with the LAV-1BRU strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In contrast, the signal for utilization of the nef/env splice acceptor for the singly spliced env transcript appeared first at 12 h and increased to maximum intensity by 24 h. The nef/env splice acceptor was dominant at all time points examined. We propose that this dominance ensures efficient downstream splicing proximal to the env initiation codon in singly spliced transcripts. However, early after infection, the dominance of the nef/env splice acceptor appears to divert primary transcripts away from tat- and rev-specific processing paths. The relative proportions of hybridization signals representing these alternative splice events remained constant throughout the viral replicative cycle. This result suggests that trans-acting factors that might influence splice choices are not induced during infection, but rather that cis-acting, sequence-specific splice preferences determine the relative efficiency of alternative acceptor utilization.},

  Abstract                 = {The AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 076 zidovudine prophylaxis regimen for HIV-1-infected pregnant women and their babies has been associated with a significant decrease in vertical HIV-1 transmission in non-breastfeeding women in developed countries. We compared the safety and efficacy of short-course nevirapine or zidovudine during labour and the first week of life.From November, 1997, to April, 1999, we enrolled 626 HIV-1-infected pregnant women at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. We randomly assigned mothers nevirapine 200 mg orally at onset of labour and 2 mg/kg to babies within 72 h of birth, or zidovudine 600 mg orally to the mother at onset of labour and 300 mg every 3 h until delivery, and 4 mg/kg orally twice daily to babies for 7 days after birth. We tested babies for HIV-1 infection at birth, 6-8 weeks, and 14-16 weeks by HIV-1 RNA PCR. We assessed HIV-1 transmission and HIV-1-free survival with Kaplan-Meier analysis.Nearly all babies (98.8\%) were breastfed, and 95.6\% were still breastfeeding at age 14-16 weeks. The estimated risks of HIV-1 transmission in the zidovudine and nevirapine groups were: 10.4\% and 8.2\% at birth (p=0.354); 21.3\% and 11.9\% by age 6-8 weeks (p=0.0027); and 25.1\% and 13.1\% by age 14-16 weeks (p=0.0006). The efficacy of nevirapine compared with zidovudine was 47\% (95\% CI 20-64) up to age 14-16 weeks. The two regimens were well tolerated and adverse events were similar in the two groups.Nevirapine lowered the risk of HIV-1 transmission during the first 14-16 weeks of life by nearly 50\% in a breastfeeding population. This simple and inexpensive regimen could decrease mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission in less-developed countries.A study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of short-course nevirapine compared with zidovudine given to women during labor and to neonates during the first week of life. 626 HIV-1 infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic from November 1997 to April 1999 at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, were randomly given nevirapine or zidovudine. Infants were tested for HIV-1 infection at birth, at 6-8 weeks, and at 14-16 weeks. Findings revealed that the estimated risk of HIV-1 transmission in the zidovudine and nevirapine groups was 10.4\% and 8.2\%, respectively, at birth; 21.3\% and 11.9\%, by 6-8 weeks; and 25.1\% and 13.1\%, by 14-16 weeks. There was a 47\% relative efficacy rate of the nevirapine regimen at 14-16 weeks compared to zidovudine. Based on the findings, nevirapine lowers the risk of HIV-1 transmission by nearly 50\% during the first 14-16 weeks of life in breast-fed infants.},

SMN is part of a stable multiprotein complex that is found in all metazoan cells in the cytoplasm and in nuclear Gems. The SMN complex contains, in addition to SMN, at least six other proteins, named Gemins2-7, and plays an essential role in the assembly of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Through its binding to specific sequences in the snRNAs, the SMN complex surveys the correct identity of the target RNAs and facilitates snRNP assembly. Based on its ability to interact with several other protein and RNA components of cellular RNPs, it is likely that the SMN complex functions as an assemblyosome in the formation of diverse RNP particles, some of which may be of particular importance to the motor neuron. A detailed understanding of the cellular roles of the SMN complex may help the development of therapeutic strategies for this neurodegenerative disease.},

Furthermore, in specific disorders like some forms of neoplasia, thalassemia and Alzheimer's disease, deregulated mRNA stability can lead to the aberrant accumulation of mRNAs and the proteins they encode. This review presents a discussion of some recently identified examples of regulated and deregulated mRNA stability in order to illustrate the diversity of genes regulated by alterations in the degradation rates of their mRNAs.},

The changes in the viral load and the CD4 cell count persisted for up to 52 weeks.

Almost as many genes are down regulated (suppressed) during interferon-ribavirin treatment as are up regulated.DNA microarrays were analyzed by different software, including MAS5 (Affymetrix-Kegg) and GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis) to identify specific pathways both up regulated and down regulated. Data was assessed from a clinical trial, which was a microarray analysis from 68 patients.Up regulated genes included genes associated with NF-kb, toll like receptor cytokine -cytokine interaction, and complement and adhesion pathways. The most prominent pathway down regulated was that for ribosomal structural proteins, and eukaryotic translational factors. Down regulation of ribosomal protein genes continued through the treatment up to the last measurement, which was at day 28.This suppression of the protein synthetic apparatus might explain the long-term side effects of interferon-ribavirin, and explain a non-specific effect of interferon-ribavirin on viral protein synthesis. There was no evidence for unique transcription factors or micro RNA involvement.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), in contrast with most other retroviruses, encodes trans-regulatory proteins for virus gene expression. It is shown in this study, by means of an in vitro splicing system, that nuclear extracts obtained from cells infected with HIV-1 contain a factor (or factors) that specifically inhibits splicing of a synthetic SP6/HIV pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA)-containing donor and acceptor splice sites in the coding region for the envelope protein. It is also shown that the SP6/HIV pre-mRNA is not capable of assembly in a ribonucleoprotein complex, spliceosome, in extracts from infected cells. These findings raise the possibility that specific inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing in the envelope protein coding region by HIV-1 trans-regulatory factors might be one control mechanism for efficient production of structural viral proteins and virion assembly.},

A quantitative technique was developed to determine viral burden in two important cellular compartments in lymphoid tissues. Image analysis and in situ hybridization were combined to show that in the presymptomatic stages of infection there is a large, relatively stable pool of virions on the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and a smaller pool of productively infected cells. Despite evidence of constraints on HIV-1 replication in the infected cell population in lymphoid tissues, estimates of the numbers of these cells and the virus they could produce are consistent with the quantities of virus that have been detected in the bloodstream. The cellular sources of virus production and storage in lymphoid tissues can now be studied with this approach over the course of infection and treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA silencing or interference (RNAi) is a gene regulation mechanism in eukaryotes that controls cell differentiation and developmental processes via expression of microRNAs. RNAi also serves as an innate antiviral defence response in plants, nematodes, and insects. This antiviral response is triggered by virus-specific double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNAs) that are produced during infection. To overcome antiviral RNAi responses, many plant and insect viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs) that enable them to replicate at higher titers. Recently, several human viruses were shown to encode RSSs, suggesting that RNAi also serves as an innate defence response in mammals. Here, we demonstrate that the Ebola virus VP35 protein is a suppressor of RNAi in mammalian cells and that its RSS activity is functionally equivalent to that of the HIV-1 Tat protein. We show that VP35 can replace HIV-1 Tat and thereby support the replication of a Tat-minus HIV-1 variant. The VP35 dsRNA-binding domain is required for this RSS activity. Vaccinia virus E3L protein and influenza A virus NS1 protein are also capable of replacing the HIV-1 Tat RSS function. These findings support the hypothesis that RNAi is part of the innate antiviral response in mammalian cells. Moreover, the results indicate that RSSs play a critical role in mammalian virus replication.},

RNAi holds great promise as a novel nucleic acid-based therapeutic against a wide variety of diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Antiviral RNAi strategies have received much attention and several compounds are currently being tested in clinical trials. Although induced RNAi is able to trigger profound and specific inhibition of virus replication, it is becoming clear that RNAi therapeutics are not as straightforward as we had initially hoped. Difficulties concerning toxicity and delivery to the right cells that earlier hampered the development of antisense-based therapeutics may also apply to RNAi. In addition, there are indications that viruses have evolved ways to escape from RNAi. Proper consideration of all of these issues will be necessary in the design of RNAi-based therapeutics for successful clinical intervention of human pathogenic viruses.},

While 9 of 10 patients were successfully treated, 4 of the 9 developed T cell leukemia 31-68 months after gene therapy. In 2 of these cases, blast cells contained activating vector insertions near the LIM domain-only 2 (LMO2) proto-oncogene. Here, we report data on the 2 most recent adverse events, which occurred in patients 7 and 10. In patient 10, blast cells contained an integrated vector near LMO2 and a second integrated vector near the proto-oncogene BMI1. In patient 7, blast cells contained an integrated vector near a third proto-oncogene,CCND2. Additional genetic abnormalities in the patients' blast cells included chromosomal translocations, gain-of-function mutations activating NOTCH1, and copy number changes, including deletion of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, 6q interstitial losses, and SIL-TAL1 rearrangement. These findings functionally specify a genetic network that controls growth in T cell progenitors. Chemotherapy led to sustained remission in 3 of the 4 cases of T cell leukemia, but failed in the fourth. Successful chemotherapy was associated with restoration of polyclonal transduced T cell populations. As a result, the treated patients continued to benefit from therapeutic gene transfer.},

We reviewed long-term outcomes after gene therapy in nine patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), which is characterized by the absence of the cytokine receptor common gamma chain.The nine patients, who lacked an HLA-identical donor, underwent ex vivo retrovirus-mediated transfer of gamma chain to autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells between 1999 and 2002. We assessed clinical events and immune function on long-term follow-up.Eight patients were alive after a median follow-up period of 9 years (range, 8 to 11). Gene therapy was initially successful at correcting immune dysfunction in eight of the nine patients. However, acute leukemia developed in four patients, and one died. Transduced T cells were detected for up to 10.7 years after gene therapy. Seven patients, including the three survivors of leukemia, had sustained immune reconstitution; three patients required immunoglobulin-replacement therapy. Sustained thymopoiesis was established by the persistent presence of naive T cells, even after chemotherapy in three patients. The T-cell-receptor repertoire was diverse in all patients. Transduced B cells were not detected. Correction of the immunodeficiency improved the patients' health.After nearly 10 years of follow-up, gene therapy was shown to have corrected the immunodeficiency associated with SCID-X1. Gene therapy may be an option for patients who do not have an HLA-identical donor for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and for whom the risks are deemed acceptable. This treatment is associated with a risk of acute leukemia. (Funded by INSERM and others.)},

  Abstract                 = {We have previously shown correction of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID-X1, also known as gamma chain (gamma(c)) deficiency] in 9 out of 10 patients by retrovirus-mediated gamma(c) gene transfer into autologous CD34 bone marrow cells. However, almost 3 years after gene therapy, uncontrolled exponential clonal proliferation of mature T cells (with gammadelta+ or alphabeta+ T cell receptors) has occurred in the two youngest patients. Both patients' clones showed retrovirus vector integration in proximity to the LMO2 proto-oncogene promoter, leading to aberrant transcription and expression of LMO2. Thus, retrovirus vector insertion can trigger deregulated premalignant cell proliferation with unexpected frequency, most likely driven by retrovirus enhancer activity on the LMO2 gene promoter.},

We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {In a study of genetic variation in the AIDS virus, HTLV-III/LAV, sequential virus isolates from persistently infected individuals were examined by Southern blot genomic analysis, molecular cloning, and nucleotide sequencing. Four to six virus isolates were obtained from each of three individuals over a 1-year or 2-year period. Changes were detected throughout the viral genomes and consisted of isolated and clustered nucleotide point mutations as well as short deletions or insertions. Results from genomic restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence comparisons indicated that viruses isolated sequentially had evolved in parallel from a common progenitor virus. The rate of evolution of HTLV-III/LAV was estimated to be at least 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the env gene and 10(-4) for the gag gene, values a millionfold greater than for most DNA genomes. Despite this relatively rapid rate of sequence divergence, virus isolates from any one patient were all much more related to each other than to viruses from other individuals. In view of the substantial heterogeneity among most independent HTLV-III/LAV isolates, the repeated isolation from a given individual of only highly related viruses raises the possibility that some type of interference mechanism may prevent simultaneous infection by more than one major genotypic form of the virus.},

Fusion activity requires proteolytic cleavage of the gp160 protein into gp120 and gp41 at a site containing several arginine and lysine residues. Activation at basic cleavage sites is observed with many membrane proteins of cellular and viral origin. We have recently found that the enzyme activating the haemagglutinin of fowl plague virus (FPV), an avian influenza virus, is furin. Furin, a subtilisin-like eukaryotic endoprotease, has a substrate specificity for the consensus amino-acid sequence Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg at the cleavage site. We show here that the glycoprotein of HIV-1, which has the same protease recognition motif as the FPV haemagglutinin, is also activated by furin.},

  Abstract                 = {Latent reservoirs of HIV-1-infected cells are refractory to antiretroviral therapies (ART) and remain the major barrier to curing HIV-1. Because latently infected cells are long-lived, immunologically invisible, and may undergo homeostatic proliferation, a "shock and kill" approach has been proposed to eradicate this reservoir by combining ART with inducers of viral transcription. However, all attempts to alter the HIV-1 reservoir in vivo have failed to date. Using humanized mice, we show that broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can interfere with establishment of a silent reservoir by Fc-FcR-mediated mechanisms. In established infection, bNAbs or bNAbs plus single inducers are ineffective in preventing viral rebound. However, bNAbs plus a combination of inducers that act by independent mechanisms synergize to decrease the reservoir as measured by viral rebound. Thus, combinations of inducers and bNAbs constitute a therapeutic strategy that impacts the establishment and maintenance of the HIV-1 reservoir in humanized mice.},

We also address one key question emerging from various Human Microbiome Projects: Is there a substantial core of abundant organisms or lineages that we all share? It appears that in some human body habitats, such as the hand and the gut, the diversity among individuals is so great that we can rule out the possibility that any species is at high abundance in all individuals: It is possible that the focus should instead be on higher-level taxa or on functional genes instead.},

Differences in pVL between PHI and CHI populations 4 weeks after stopping ART were examined using linear and logistic regression. Differences in pVL slopes up to 48 weeks were examined using linear mixed models and viral burden was estimated through a time-averaged area-under-pVL curve. CHI participants were categorised by nadir CD4 at ART stop.Of 171 PHI participants, 71 (41.5\%) rebounded to pre-ART pVL levels, at a median of 50 (95\% CI 48-51) weeks after stopping ART. Four weeks after stopping treatment, although the proportion with pVL ≥ 400 copies/ml was similar (78\% PHI versus 79\% CHI), levels were 0.45 (95\% CI 0.26-0.64) log(10) copies/ml lower for PHI versus CHI, and remained lower up to 48 weeks. Lower CD4 nadir in CHI was associated with higher pVL after ART stop. Rebound for CHI participants with CD4 nadir >500 cells/mm(3) was comparable to that experienced by PHI participants.Stopping ART initiated in PHI and CHI was associated with viral rebound to levels conferring increased transmission risk, although the level of rebound was significantly lower and sustained in PHI compared to CHI.},

The primary end point was a > or = 50 percent decline in the CD4 cell count, development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or death.Progression to the primary end point was more frequent with zidovudine alone (32 percent) than with zidovudine plus didanosine (18 percent; relative hazard ratio, 0.50; P<0.001), zidovudine plus zalcitabine (20 percent; relative hazard ratio, 0.54; P<0.001), or didanosine alone (22 percent; relative hazard ratio, 0.61; P<0.001). The relative hazard ratios for progression to an AIDS-defining event or death were 0.64 (P=0.005) for zidovudine plus didanosine, as compared with zidovudine alone, 0.77 (P=0.085) for zidovudine plus zalcitabine, and 0.69 (P=0.019) for didanosine alone. The relative hazard ratios for death were 0.55 (P=0.008), 0.71 (P=0.10), and 0.51 (P=0.003), respectively. For zidovudine plus zalcitabine, the benefits were limited to those without previous treatment.Treatment with zidovudine plus didanosine, zidovudine plus zalcitabine, or didanosine alone slows the progression of HIV disease and is superior to treatment with zidovudine alone. Antiretroviral therapy can improve survival in patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter.},

We compared treatment with the protease inhibitor indinavir in addition to zidovudine and lamivudine with treatment with the two nucleosides alone in HIV-infected adults previously treated with zidovudine.A total of 1156 patients not previously treated with lamivudine or protease inhibitors were stratified according to CD4 cell count (50 or fewer vs. 51 to 200 cells per cubic millimeter) and randomly assigned to one of two daily regimens: 600 mg of zidovudine (or stavudine) and 300 mg of lamivudine, or that regimen with 2400 mg of indinavir. The primary end point was the time to the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death.The proportion of patients whose disease progressed to AIDS or death was lower with indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine (6 percent) than with zidovudine and lamivudine alone (11 percent; estimated hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.76; P=0.001). Mortality in the two groups was 1.4 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively (estimated hazard ratio, 0.43; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.99; P=0.04). The effects of treatment were similar in both CD4 cell strata. The responses of CD4 cells and plasma HIV-1 RNA paralleled the clinical results.Treatment with indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine as compared with zidovudine and lamivudine alone significantly slows the progression of HIV-1 disease in patients with 200 CD4 cells or fewer per cubic millimeter and prior exposure to zidovudine.},

  Abstract                 = {Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are skin diseases that are characterized by polarized CD4+ T cell responses. During the polarization of naïve CD4+ T cells, DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation status of naïve CD4+ T cells in patients with psoriasis or AD and healthy controls using a ChIP-seq method. Only psoriasis patient T cells, not those of AD patients, showed distinct hypomethylation (>4-fold) compared to healthy control T cells in twenty-six regions of the genome ranging in size from 10 to 70 kb. These regions were mostly pericentromeric on 10 different chromosomes and incidentally coincided with various strong epigenomic signals, such as histone modifications and transcription factor binding sites, that had been observed in the ENCODE project implying the potential epigenetic regulation in psoriasis development. The gene-centric analysis indicated that the promoter regions of 121 genes on the X chromosome had dramatically elevated methylation levels in psoriasis patient T-cells compared to those from healthy controls (>4-fold). Moreover, immune-related genes on the X chromosome had higher hypermethylation than other genes (P=0.046). No such patterns were observed with AD patient T cells. These findings imply that methylation changes in naïve CD4+ T cells may affect CD4+ T cell polarization, especially in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.},

  Abstract                 = {Resting CD4+ T-cell populations from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals include cells with integrated HIV-1 DNA. In individuals showing suppression of viremia during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), resting CD4+ T-cell populations do not produce virus without cellular activation. To determine whether the nonproductive nature of the infection in resting CD4+ T cells is due to retroviral integration into chromosomal regions that are repressive for transcription, we used inverse PCR to characterize the HIV-1 integration sites in vivo in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on HAART. Of 74 integration sites from 16 patients, 93\% resided within transcription units, usually within introns. Integration was random with respect to transcriptional orientation relative to the host gene and with respect to position within the host gene. Of integration sites within well-characterized genes, 91\% (51 of 56) were in genes that were actively expressed in resting CD4+ T cells, as directly demonstrated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). These results predict that HIV-1 sequences may be included in the primary transcripts of host genes as part of rapidly degraded introns. RT-PCR experiments confirmed the presence of HIV-1 sequences within transcripts initiating upstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HIV-1 genomes reside within actively transcribed host genes in resting CD4+ T cells in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {Integrated HIV-1 genomes are found within actively transcribed host genes in latently infected CD4(+) T cells. Readthrough transcription of the host gene might therefore suppress HIV-1 gene expression and promote the latent infection that allows viral persistence in patients on therapy. To address the effect of host gene readthrough, we used homologous recombination to insert HIV-1 genomes in either orientation into an identical position within an intron of an actively transcribed host gene, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Constructs were engineered to permit or block readthrough transcription of HPRT. Readthrough transcription inhibited HIV-1 gene expression for convergently orientated provirus but enhanced HIV-1 gene expression when HIV-1 was in the same orientation as the host gene. Orientation had a >10-fold effect on HIV-1 gene expression. Due to the nature of HIV-1 integration sites in vivo, this orientation-dependent regulation can influence the vast majority of infected cells and adds complexity to the maintenance of latency.},

However, such studies are still taxed to determine both the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their relative abundance in a sample. RESULTS: To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian clustering method termed Clustering 16S rRNA for OTU Prediction (CROP). CROP can find clusters based on the natural organization of data without setting a hard cut-off threshold (3\%/5\%) as required by hierarchical clustering methods. By applying our method to several datasets, we demonstrate that CROP is robust against sequencing errors and that it produces more accurate results than conventional hierarchical clustering methods.

  Abstract                 = {Integrase is an essential retroviral enzyme that binds both termini of linear viral DNA and inserts them into a host cell chromosome. The structure of full-length retroviral integrase, either separately or in complex with DNA, has been lacking. Furthermore, although clinically useful inhibitors of HIV integrase have been developed, their mechanism of action remains speculative. Here we present a crystal structure of full-length integrase from the prototype foamy virus in complex with its cognate DNA. The structure shows the organization of the retroviral intasome comprising an integrase tetramer tightly associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. All three canonical integrase structural domains are involved in extensive protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The binding of strand-transfer inhibitors displaces the reactive viral DNA end from the active site, disarming the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our findings define the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration, and will allow modelling of the HIV-1 intasome to aid in the development of antiretroviral drugs.},

Here, using a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based system, we provide evidence that CEM15/APOBEC3G is a DNA deaminase that is incorporated into virions during viral production and subsequently triggers massive deamination of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine within the retroviral minus (first)-strand cDNA, thus providing a probable trigger for viral destruction. Furthermore, HIV Vif can protect MLV from this CEM15/APOBEC3G-dependent restriction. These findings imply that targeted DNA deamination is a major strategy of innate immunity to retroviruses and likely also contributes to the sequence variation observed in many viruses (including HIV).},

A DNA polymerase adds labeled nucleotides to surface-immobilized primer-template duplexes in stepwise fashion, and the asynchronous growth of individual DNA molecules was monitored by fluorescence imaging. Read lengths of >25 bases and equivalent phred software program quality scores approaching 30 were achieved. We used this method to sequence the M13 virus to an average depth of >150x and with 100\% coverage; thus, we resequenced the M13 genome with high-sensitivity mutation detection.

  Abstract                 = {Interaction of cis-acting RNA sequences with nucleocapsid proteins is one of the critical events leading to retroviral genomic RNA packaging. We have derived a potentially stable secondary structure for the packaging signal region of human immunodeficiency virus strain IIIB, using a combination of biochemical analysis and computer modelling. This region encompasses the major splice donor (SD), which is found in a highly structured conserved stem-loop. Comparison with other published human immunodeficiency virus type 1 sequences shows almost absolute nucleotide conservation in base-paired regions required to maintain this structure. Presently and previously described packaging-defective mutants would disrupt the structure. The structure depends on base pairing between nucleotide sequences 5' of the major SD which are common to both genomic and subgenomic RNAs and sequences 3' of SD which are unique to the unspliced RNA. This may explain how in retroviruses such as Rous sarcoma virus, mutations in regions common to genomic and subgenomic RNA might prevent packaging of the unspliced mRNA by disrupting a signal structure which can exist only in the genomic RNA species.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the prevalence and biological relevance of both signaling pathways and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, our knowledge of how intracellular signaling impacts on alternative splicing regulation remains fragmentary. We report a genome-wide analysis using splicing-sensitive microarrays of changes in alternative splicing induced by activation of two distinct signaling pathways, insulin and wingless, in Drosophila cells in culture.Alternative splicing changes induced by insulin affect more than 150 genes and more than 50 genes are regulated by wingless activation. About 40\% of the genes showing changes in alternative splicing also show regulation of mRNA levels, suggesting distinct but also significantly overlapping programs of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Distinct functional sets of genes are regulated by each pathway and, remarkably, a significant overlap is observed between functional categories of genes regulated transcriptionally and at the level of alternative splicing. Functions related to carbohydrate metabolism and cellular signaling are enriched among genes regulated by insulin and wingless, respectively. Computational searches identify pathway-specific sequence motifs enriched near regulated 5' splice sites.Taken together, our data indicate that signaling cascades trigger pathway-specific and biologically coherent regulatory programs of alternative splicing regulation. They also reveal that alternative splicing can provide a novel molecular mechanism for crosstalk between different signaling pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {In Drosophila melanogaster, female-specific expression of Sex-lethal (SXL) and Transformer (TRA) proteins controls sex-specific alternative splicing and/or translation of a handful of regulatory genes responsible for sexual differentiation and behavior. Recent findings in 2009 by Telonis-Scott et al. document widespread sex-biased alternative splicing in fruitflies, including instances of tissue-restricted sex-specific splicing. Here we report results arguing that some of these novel sex-specific splicing events are regulated by mechanisms distinct from those established by female-specific expression of SXL and TRA. Bioinformatic analysis of SXL/TRA binding sites, experimental analysis of sex-specific splicing in S2 and Kc cells lines and of the effects of SXL knockdown in Kc cells indicate that SXL-dependent and SXL-independent regulatory mechanisms coexist within the same cell. Additional determinants of sex-specific splicing can be provided by sex-specific differences in the expression of RNA binding proteins, including Hrp40/Squid. We report that sex-specific alternative splicing of the gene hrp40/squid leads to sex-specific differences in the levels of this hnRNP protein. The significant overlap between sex-regulated alternative splicing changes and those induced by knockdown of hrp40/squid and the presence of related sequence motifs enriched near subsets of Hrp40/Squid-regulated and sex-regulated splice sites indicate that this protein contributes to sex-specific splicing regulation. A significant fraction of sex-specific splicing differences are absent in germline-less tudor mutant flies. Intriguingly, these include alternative splicing events that are differentially spliced in tissues distant from the germline. Collectively, our results reveal that distinct genetic programs control widespread sex-specific splicing in Drosophila melanogaster.},

We previously found that Vpr plays a novel role as a regulator of pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro. However, the cellular target of Vpr, as well as the mechanism of cellular pre-mRNA splicing inhibition by Vpr, is unknown. Here, we show clearly that Vpr inhibits the splicing of cellular pre-mRNA, such as beta-globin pre-mRNA and immunoglobulin (Ig) M pre-mRNA and that the third alpha-helical domain and arginine-rich region are important its ability to inhibit splicing. Additionally, using mutants with specific substitutions in two domains of Vpr, we demonstrated that the interaction between Vpr and SAP145, an essential splicing factor, was indispensable for splicing inhibition. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro competitive binding assays indicated that Vpr associates with SAP145 and interferes with SAP145-SAP49 complex formation. Thus, these results suggest that cellular expression of Vpr may block spliceosome assembly by interfering with the function of the SAP145-SAP49 complex in host cells.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Searching for non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes and structural RNA elements (eleRNA) are major challenges in gene finding today as these often are conserved in structure rather than in sequence. Even though the number of available methods is growing, it is still of interest to pairwise detect two genes with low sequence similarity, where the genes are part of a larger genomic region. RESULTS: Here we present such an approach for pairwise local alignment which is based on foldalign and the Sankoff algorithm for simultaneous structural alignment of multiple sequences. We include the ability to conduct mutual scans of two sequences of arbitrary length while searching for common local structural motifs of some maximum length. This drastically reduces the complexity of the algorithm. The scoring scheme includes structural parameters corresponding to those available for free energy as well as for substitution matrices similar to RIBOSUM. The new foldalign implementation is tested on a dataset where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs have sequence similarity <40\% and where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs are energetically indistinguishable from the surrounding genomic sequence context. The method is tested in two ways: (1) its ability to find the common structure between the genes only and (2) its ability to locate ncRNAs and eleRNAs in a genomic context. In case (1), it makes sense to compare with methods like Dynalign, and the performances are very similar, but foldalign is substantially faster. The structure prediction performance for a family is typically around 0.7 using Matthews correlation coefficient. In case (2), the algorithm is successful at locating RNA families with an average sensitivity of 0.8 and a positive predictive value of 0.9 using a BLAST-like hit selection scheme.

  Abstract                 = {To explore the possibility that an arbitrary sequence can evolve towards acquiring functional role when fused with other pre-existing protein modules, we replaced the D2 domain of the fd-tet phage genome with the soluble random polypeptide RP3-42. The replacement yielded an fd-RP defective phage that is six-order magnitude lower infectivity than the wild-type fd-tet phage. The evolvability of RP3-42 was investigated through iterative mutation and selection. Each generation consists of a maximum of ten arbitrarily chosen clones, whereby the clone with highest infectivity was selected to be the parent clone of the generation that followed. The experimental evolution attested that, from an initial single random sequence, there will be selectable variation in a property of interest and that the property in question was able to improve over several generations. fd-7, the clone with highest infectivity at the end of the experimental evolution, showed a 240-fold increase in infectivity as compared to its origin, fd-RP. Analysis by phage ELISA using anti-M13 antibody and anti-T7 antibody revealed that about 37-fold increase in the infectivity of fd-7 was attributed to the changes in the molecular property of the single polypeptide that replaced the D2 domain of the g3p protein. This study therefore exemplifies the process of a random polypeptide generating a functional role in rejuvenating the infectivity of a defective bacteriophage when fused to some preexisting protein modules, indicating that an arbitrary sequence can evolve toward acquiring a functional role. Overall, this study could herald the conception of new perspective regarding primordial polypeptides in the field of molecular evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Repression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription may contribute to the establishment or maintenance of proviral quiescence in infected CD4(+) cells. The host factors YY1 and LSF cooperatively recruit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and inhibit transcription. We demonstrate here regulation of occupancy of HDAC1 at a positioned nucleosome (nuc 1) near the transcription start site of integrated LTR. We find that expression of YY1 increases occupancy by HDAC1, decreases acetylation at nuc 1, and downregulates LTR expression. HDAC1 recruitment and histone hypoacetylation were also seen when Tat activation was inhibited by the overexpression of YY1. A YY1 mutant without an HDAC1 interaction domain and incompetent to inhibit LTR activation fails to recruit HDAC1 to LTR or decrease nuc 1 acetylation. Further, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of LSF (dnLSF), which inhibits LSF occupancy and LTR repression, results in acetylation and decreased HDAC1 occupancy at nuc 1. Conversely, exposure of cells to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A or activation of LTR expression by HIV-1 Tat results in the displacement of HDAC1 from nuc 1, in association with increased acetylation of histone H4. Recruitment of HDAC1 to the LTR nuc 1 can counteract Tat activation and repress LTR expression. Significantly, when repression is overcome, LTR activation is associated with decreased HDAC1 occupancy. Since the persistence of integrated HIV-1 genomes despite potent suppression of viral replication is a major obstacle for current antiretroviral therapy, strategies to selectively disrupt the quiescence of chromosomal provirus may play a role in the future treatment of AIDS.},

Individuals with defective CCR5 alleles exhibit resistance to HIV-1 infection, suggesting that CCR5 has an important role in vivo in HIV-1 replication. A subset of primary viruses can use CCR3 as well as CCR5 as a co-receptor, but the in vivo contribution of CCR3 to HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis is unknown. HIV-1 infects the central nervous system (CNS) and causes the dementia associated with AIDS. Here we report that the major target cells for HIV-1 infection in the CNS, the microglia, express both CCR3 and CCR5. The CCR3 ligand, eotaxin, and an anti-CCR3 antibody inhibited HIV-1 infection of microglia, as did MIP-1beta, which is a CCR5 ligand.

In cycling cells, progression from G2 to M phase is driven by activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex, an event caused, in part, by dephosphorylation of two regulatory amino acids of p34cdc2 (Thr-14 and Tyr-15). We show here that Vpr arrests the cell cycle in G2 by preventing the activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex. Vpr expression in cells caused p34cdc2 to remain in the phosphorylated, inactive state, p34cdc2/cyclin B complexes immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Vpr were almost completely inactive in a histone H1 kinase assay. Coexpression of a constitutively active mutant p34cdc2 molecule with Vpr relieved the G2 arrest. These findings strongly suggest that Vpr arrests cells in G2 by preventing the activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex that is required for entry into M phase. In vivo, Vpr might, by preventing p34cdc2 activation, delay or prevent apoptosis of infected cells. This would increase the amount of virus each infected cell produced.},

  Abstract                 = {Novel high-throughput deep sequencing technology has dramatically changed the way that the functional complexity of transcriptomes can be studied. Here we report on the first use of this technology to gain insight into the wide range of transcriptional responses that are associated with an infectious disease process. Using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based transcriptome sequencing method, we investigated mycobacterium-induced transcriptome changes in a model vertebrate species, the zebrafish. We obtained a sequencing depth of over 5 million tags per sample with strong correlation between replicates. Tag mapping indicated that healthy and infected adult zebrafish express over 70\% of all genes represented in transcript databases. Comparison of the data with a previous multi-platform microarray analysis showed that both types of technologies identified regulation of similar functional groups of genes. However, the unbiased nature of DGE analysis provided insights that microarray analysis could not have achieved. In particular, we show that DGE data sets are instrumental for verification of predicted gene models and allowed us to detect mycobacterium-regulated switching between different transcript isoforms. Moreover, genomic mapping of infection-induced DGE tags revealed novel transcript forms for which any previous EST-based evidence of expression was lacking. In conclusion, our deep sequencing analysis revealed in depth the high degree of transcriptional complexity of the host response to mycobacterial infection and resulted in the discovery and validation of new gene products with induced expression in infected individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {According to current estimations ∼95\% of multi-exonic human protein-coding genes undergo alternative splicing (AS). However, for 4000 human proteins in PDB, only 14 human proteins have structures of at least two alternative isoforms. Surveying these structural isoforms revealed that the maximum insertion accommodated by an isoform of a fully ordered protein domain was 5 amino acids, other instances of domain changes involved intrinsic structural disorder. After collecting 505 minor isoforms of human proteins with evidence for their existence we analyzed their length, protein disorder and exposed hydrophobic surface. We found that strict rules govern the selection of alternative splice variants aimed to preserve the integrity of globular domains: alternative splice sites (i) tend to avoid globular domains or (ii) affect them only marginally or (iii) tend to coincide with a location where the exposed hydrophobic surface is minimal or (iv) the protein is disordered. We also observed an inverse correlation between the domain fraction lost and the full length of the minor isoform containing the domain, possibly indicating a buffering effect for the isoform protein counteracting the domain truncation effect. These observations provide the basis for a prediction method (currently under development) to predict the viability of splice variants.},

  Abstract                 = {The replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in nondividing host cells such as those of macrophage lineage is an important feature of AIDS pathogenesis. The pattern of HIV-1 replication is dictated, in part, by the nucleophilic property of the viral gag matrix (MA) protein, a component of the viral preintegration complex that facilitates nuclear localization of viral nucleic acids in the absence of mitosis. We now identify the accessory viral protein Vpr, as a second nucleophilic component that influences nuclear localization of viral nucleic acids in nondividing cells. Reverse transcription and nuclear localization of viral nucleic acids following infection of cells by viruses lacking Vpr or viruses containing mutations in a gag MA nuclear localization sequence were indistinguishable from the pattern observed in cells infected by wild-type HIV-1. These viruses retained the ability to replicate in both dividing and nondividing host cells including monocyte-derived macrophages. In contrast, introduction of both gag MA and Vpr mutations in HIV-1 attenuated nuclear localization of viral nucleic acids in nondividing cells and virus replication in monocyte-derived macrophages. These studies demonstrate redundant nucleophilic determinants of HIV-1 that independently permit nuclear localization of viral nucleic acids and virus replication in nondividing cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages. In addition, these studies provide a defined function for an accessory gene product of HIV-1.},

The cytokine interferon-β (IFN-β) is widely used as an immunomodulatory drug for multiple sclerosis and its functional pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been previously described. The aim of the present study was to identify novel, cell-specific IFN-β functions and pathways in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-activated monocytes that may have been missed in studies using PBMCs.Whole genome gene expression profiles of human monocytes and T cells were compared following in vitro priming to TNF-α and overnight exposure to IFN-β. Statistical analyses of the gene expression data revealed a cell-type-specific change of 699 transcripts, 667 monocyte-specific transcripts, 21 T cell-specific transcripts and 11 transcripts with either a difference in the response direction or a difference in the magnitude of response. RT-PCR revealed a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), exhibiting responses to IFN-β that are modulated by TNF-α in monocytes, such as RIPK2 and CD83, but not in T cells or PBMCs. Known IFN-β promoter response elements, such as ISRE, were enriched in T cell DEGs but not in monocyte DEGs. The overall directionality of the gene expression regulation by IFN-β was different in T cells and monocytes, with up-regulation more prevalent in T cells, and a similar extent of up and down-regulation recorded in monocytes.By focusing on the response of distinct cell types and by evaluating the combined effects of two cytokines with pro and anti-inflammatory activities, we were able to present two new findings First, new IFN-β response pathways and genes, some of which were monocytes specific; second, a cell-specific modulation of the IFN-β response transcriptome by TNF-α.},

We tested the hypothesis of changing HIV-1 virulence by examining trends in prognostic clinical markers of disease progression from 1984 to 2005 among nearly 400 antiretroviral-naïve participants in the United States Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longitudinal study of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM).Because clinical AIDS endpoints could not be used (due to antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis), three prognostic markers of disease progression were used as proxies for HIV-1 virulence: plasma viral RNA load and CD4+ T cell count at "set point" (between approximately 9 and approximately 15 months after seroconversion), and rate of CD4 cell decline within three years after seroconversion. We performed multivariate analyses of the association between these markers and seroconversion year, with covariates including MACS site, race/ethnic group, seroconversion age, and CCR5Delta32 status. No statistically significant association was found between year of seroconversion and "set point" plasma viral load (at approximately 9 months after seroconversion: slope = -0.004 log(10) copies/mL/year, p = 0.76; at approximately 15 months: slope = -0.005 log(10) copies/mL/year, p = 0.71), CD4 cell count after seroconversion (at approximately 9 months: slope = -0.112 cells/microL/year, p = 0.22; at approximately 15 months: slope = -0.047 cells/microL/year, p = 0.64), or rate of CD4 cell decline over the first three years after seroconversion (slope = -0.010 cells/ul/yr(2), p = 0.88).The lack of significant trends from 1984 to 2005 in these prognostic markers of HIV disease progression suggests no major change in HIV-1 virulence over the AIDS pandemic in MSM in the US.},

Using a nuclease protection strategy to detect downstream, readthrough, and normal viral RNAs and to distinguish them from each other, we found that transcripts initiated within the 3' long terminal repeat, i.e., downstream transcripts, were undetectable in infected fibroblasts and could not have amounted to more than 1 to 2\% of the total viral RNA. However, readthrough RNAs, which are transcripts initiated within the 5' long terminal repeat and extended beyond the viral polyadenylation site into the downstream cellular DNA, were present at relatively high levels, making up approximately 15\% of the total viral RNA.},

  Abstract                 = {In individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, a small reservoir of resting memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes carrying latent, integrated provirus persists even in patients treated for prolonged periods with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This reservoir greatly complicates the prospects for eradicating HIV-1 infection with antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, it is critical to understand how HIV-1 latency is established and maintained. In particular, it is important to determine whether transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved. Therefore, HIV-1 DNA and mRNAs were measured in highly purified populations of resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients on long-term HAART. In such patients, the predominant form of persistent HIV-1 is latent integrated provirus. Typically, 100 HIV-1 DNA molecules were detected per 10(6) resting CD4(+) T cells. Only very low levels of unspliced HIV-1 RNA ( approximately 50 copies/10(6) resting CD4(+) T cells) were detected using a reverse transcriptase PCR assay capable of detecting a single molecule of RNA standard. Levels of multiply spliced HIV-1 RNA were below the limit of detection (<50 copies/10(6) cells). Only 1\% of the HIV-1 DNA-positive lymphocytes in this compartment could be induced to up-regulate HIV-1 mRNAs after cellular activation, indicating that most of the proviral DNA in resting CD4(+) T cells either carries intrinsic defects precluding transcription or is subjected to transcriptional control mechanisms that preclude high-level production of multiply spliced mRNAs. Nevertheless, by inducing T-cell activation, it is possible to isolate replication-competent virus from resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes of all infected individuals, including those on prolonged HAART. Thus, a subset of integrated proviruses (1\%) remains competent for high-level mRNA production after cellular activation, and a subset of these can produce infectious virus. Measurements of steady-state levels of multiply spliced and unspliced HIV-1 RNA prior to cellular activation suggest that infected resting CD4(+) T lymphocytes in blood synthesize very little viral RNA and are unlikely to be capable of producing virus. In these cells, latency appears to reflect regulation at the level of mRNA production rather than at the level of splicing or nuclear export of viral mRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {Massive research efforts are now underway to develop a cure for HIV infection, allowing patients to discontinue lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). New latency-reversing agents (LRAs) may be able to purge the persistent reservoir of latent virus in resting memory CD4(+) T cells, but the degree of reservoir reduction needed for cure remains unknown. Here we use a stochastic model of infection dynamics to estimate the efficacy of LRA needed to prevent viral rebound after ART interruption. We incorporate clinical data to estimate population-level parameter distributions and outcomes. Our findings suggest that ∼2,000-fold reductions are required to permit a majority of patients to interrupt ART for 1 y without rebound and that rebound may occur suddenly after multiple years. Greater than 10,000-fold reductions may be required to prevent rebound altogether. Our results predict large variation in rebound times following LRA therapy, which will complicate clinical management. This model provides benchmarks for moving LRAs from the laboratory to the clinic and can aid in the design and interpretation of clinical trials. These results also apply to other interventions to reduce the latent reservoir and can explain the observed return of viremia after months of apparent cure in recent bone marrow transplant recipients and an immediately-treated neonate.},

The crystal structure of the HIV-1 matrix protein, determined at 2.3 angstrom resolution, reveals that individual matrix molecules are composed of five major helices capped by a three-stranded mixed beta-sheet. Unexpectedly, the protein assembles into a trimer in three different crystal lattices, burying 1880 angstrom2 of accessible surface area at the trimer interfaces. Trimerization appears to create a large, bipartite membrane binding surface in which exposed basic residues could cooperate with the N-terminal myristoyl groups to anchor the protein on the acidic inner membrane of the virus.},

Because these instruments are new, their data require characterization with respect to accuracy and utility. To address this, we sequenced a Caernohabditis elegans N2 Bristol strain isolate using the Solexa Sequence Analyzer, and compared the reads to the reference genome to characterize the data and to evaluate coverage and representation. Massively parallel sequencing facilitates strain-to-reference comparison for genome-wide sequence variant discovery. Owing to the short-read-length sequences produced, we developed a revised approach to determine the regions of the genome to which short reads could be uniquely mapped. We then aligned Solexa reads from C. elegans strain CB4858 to the reference, and screened for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels. This study demonstrates the utility of massively parallel short read sequencing for whole genome resequencing and for accurate discovery of genome-wide polymorphisms.},

The data provide experimental support for >85\% of the annotated protein-coding transcripts in WormBase (WS170) and confirm additional details of processing. For example, the total number of confirmed splice junctions was raised from 70,911 to over 98,000. The data also suggest thousands of modifications to WormBase annotations and identify new spliced junctions and genes not part of any WormBase annotation, including at least 80 putative genes not found in any of three predicted gene sets. The quantitative nature of the data also suggests that mRNA levels may be measured by this approach with unparalleled precision. Although most sequences align with protein-coding genes, a small fraction falls in introns and intergenic regions.

  Abstract                 = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTC+ mRNAs). In mammals, a termination codon is recognized as premature if it lies more than about 50 nucleotides upstream of the final intron position. More than a third of reliably inferred alternative splicing events in humans have been shown to result in PTC+ mRNA isoforms. As the mechanistic details of NMD have only recently been elucidated, we hypothesized that many PTC+ isoforms may have been cloned, characterized and deposited in the public databases, even though they would be targeted for degradation in vivo.We analyzed the human alternative protein isoforms described in the SWISS-PROT database and found that 144 (5.8\% of 2,483) isoform sequences amenable to analysis, from 107 (7.9\% of 1,363) SWISS-PROT entries, derive from PTC+ mRNA.For several of the PTC+ isoforms we identified, existing experimental evidence can be reinterpreted and is consistent with the action of NMD to degrade the transcripts. Several genes with mRNA isoforms that we identified as PTC+--calpain-10, the CDC-like kinases (CLKs) and LARD--show how previous experimental results may be understood in light of NMD.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative analysis of the relationship between virus expression and disease outcome has been critical for understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis. Yet the amount of viral RNA contained within an HIV-expressing cell and the relationship between the number of virus-producing cells and plasma virus load has not been established or reflected in models of viral dynamics. We report here a novel strategy for the coordinated analysis of virus expression in lymph node specimens. The results obtained for patients with a broad range of plasma viral loads before and after antiretroviral therapy reveal a constant mean viral (v)RNA copy number (3.6 log10 copies) per infected cell, regardless of plasma virus load or treatment status. In addition, there was a significant but nonlinear direct correlation between the frequency of vRNA+ lymph node cells and plasma vRNA. As predicted from this relationship, residual cells expressing this same mean copy number are detectable (frequency <2/10(6) cells) in tissues of treated patients who have plasma vRNA levels below the current detectable threshold (<50 copies/ml). These data suggest that fully replication-active cells are responsible for sustaining viremia after initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy and that plasma virus titers correlate, albeit in a nonlinear fashion, with the number of virus-expressing cells in lymphoid tissue.},

  Abstract                 = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

Early reports suggested that in this outbreak EBOV is mutating twice as fast as previously observed, which indicates the potential for changes in transmissibility and virulence and could render current molecular diagnostics and countermeasures ineffective. We have determined additional full-length sequences from two clusters of imported EBOV infections into Mali, and we show that the nucleotide substitution rate (9.6 × 10(-4) substitutions per site per year) is consistent with rates observed in Central African outbreaks. In addition, overall variation among all genotypes observed remains low. Thus, our data indicate that EBOV is not undergoing rapid evolution in humans during the current outbreak. This finding has important implications for outbreak response and public health decisions and should alleviate several previously raised concerns.},

The most straightforward approach is to compute circular structures from 'internal' and 'external' substructures separated by a base pair. This is incompatible, however, with the memory-saving approach of the Vienna RNA Package which builds a linear RNA structure from shorter (internal) structures only. RESULT: Here we describe how circular secondary structures can be obtained without additional memory requirements as a kind of 'post-processing' of the linear structures. AVAILABILITY: The circular folding algorithm is implemented in the current version of the of RNAfold program of the Vienna RNA Package, which can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/},

Considerable sequence diversity in the V3 region was found at all time points after seroconversion. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that an important diversification had occurred by 3 years postinfection and that, subsequently, most sequences could be allocated to either one of two major lineages that persisted throughout the remainder of the infection. Rapid changes in frequency of the most common sequences and the observation that the same hexapeptide motif (GPGSAV) at the crown of the V3 loop has evolved convergently provide strong evidence that selective processes determine the evolutionary fate of sequence variants in this region.},

We generated whole-genome sequences for 19 Typhi isolates using 454 (Roche) and Solexa (Illumina) technologies. Isolates, including the previously sequenced CT18 and Ty2 isolates, were selected to represent major nodes in the phylogenetic tree. Comparative analysis showed little evidence of purifying selection, antigenic variation or recombination between isolates. Rather, evolution in the Typhi population seems to be characterized by ongoing loss of gene function, consistent with a small effective population size. The lack of evidence for antigenic variation driven by immune selection is in contrast to strong adaptive selection for mutations conferring antibiotic resistance in Typhi. The observed patterns of genetic isolation and drift are consistent with the proposed key role of asymptomatic carriers of Typhi as the main reservoir of this pathogen, highlighting the need for identification and treatment of carriers.},

This HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay is simple and rapid, and amplification can be completed within 35min under isothermal conditions at 60 degrees C. The 100\% detection limit of HIV-1 RT-LAMP was determined using a standard strain (WHO HIV-1 [97/656]) in octuplicate and found to be 120 copies/ml. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated for use for clinical diagnosis using plasma samples collected from 57 HIV-1-infected and 40 uninfected individuals in Cameroon, where highly divergent HIV-1 strains are prevalent. Of the 57 samples from infected individuals, 56 harbored group-M HIV-1 strains, such as subtypes A, B, G, F2, and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) _01, _02, _09, _11, _13; all were RT-LAMP positive. One sample harboring group-O HIV-1 and the 40 HIV-1-uninfected samples were RT-LAMP negative. These findings indicate that HIV-1 RT-LAMP can detect HIV-1 group-M RNA from plasma samples rapidly and with high sensitivity and specificity. These data also suggest that this RT-LAMP assay can be useful for confirming HIV diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.},

  Abstract                 = {Over 150,000 Malawians have started antiretroviral therapy (ART), in which first-line therapy is stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. We evaluated drug resistance patterns among patients failing first-line ART on the basis of clinical or immunological criteria in Lilongwe and Blantyre, Malawi.Patients meeting the definition of ART failure (new or progressive stage 4 condition, CD4 cell count decline more than 30\%, CD4 cell count less than that before treatment) from January 2006 to July 2007 were evaluated. Among those with HIV RNA of more than 1000 copies/ml, genotyping was performed. For complex genotype patterns, phenotyping was performed.Ninety-six confirmed ART failure patients were identified. Median (interquartile range) CD4 cell count, log10 HIV-1 RNA, and duration on ART were 68 cells/microl (23-174), 4.72 copies/ml (4.26-5.16), and 36.5 months (26.6-49.8), respectively. Ninety-three percent of samples had nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, and 81\% had the M184V mutation. The most frequent pattern included M184V and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations along with at least one thymidine analog mutation (56\%). Twenty-three percent of patients acquired the K70E or K65R mutations associated with tenofovir resistance; 17\% of the patients had pan-nucleoside resistance that corresponded to K65R or K70E and additional resistance mutations, most commonly the 151 complex. Emergence of the K65R and K70E mutations was associated with CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells/microl (odds ratio 6.1) and inversely with the use of zidovudine (odds ratio 0.18). Phenotypic susceptibility data indicated that the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone with the highest activity for subsequent therapy was zidovudine/lamivudine/tenofovir, followed by lamivudine/tenofovir, and then abacavir/didanosine.When clinical and CD4 cell count criteria are used to monitor first-line ART failure, extensive nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance emerges, with most patients having resistance profiles that markedly compromise the activity of second-line ART.},

  Abstract                 = {Trans-splicing, the in vivo joining of two independently transcribed RNA molecules, is well characterized in lower eukaryotes, but was long thought absent from metazoans. However, recent bioinformatic analyses of EST sequences suggested widespread trans-splicing in mammals. These apparently spliced transcripts generally lacked canonical splice sites, leading us to question their authenticity. Particularly, the native ability of reverse transcriptase enzymes to template switch during transcription could produce apparently trans-spliced sequences.Here we report an in vitro system for the analysis of template switching in reverse transcription. Using highly purified RNA substrates, we show the reproducible occurrence of apparent trans-splicing between two RNA molecules. Other reported non-canonical splicing events such as exon shuffling and sense-antisense fusions were also readily detected. The latter caused the production of apparent antisense non-coding RNAs, which are also reported to be abundant in humans.We propose that most reported examples of non-canonical splicing in metazoans arise through template switching by reverse transcriptase during cDNA preparation. We further show that the products of template switching can vary between reverse transcriptases, providing a simple diagnostic for identifying many of these experimental artifacts.},

  Abstract                 = {Genomewide DNA hypomethylation is a consistent finding in human tumors, but the importance of this change for human tumorigenesis remains an open question. We have previously reported that mice carrying a hypomorphic allele for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1(chip/-)) are hypomethylated and develop thymic lymphomas, demonstrating that genomewide DNA hypomethylation can induce tumors. Hypomethylated cells exhibit inherent chromosomal instability, which is revealed in the lymphomas as a consistent trisomy of chromosome 15. We now report another aspect of the molecular basis for tumor development upon DNA hypomethylation. Seven out of 16 hypomethylation-induced lymphomas were found to contain an intracisternal A particle (IAP) somatic insertion in the middle of the Notch1 genomic locus, leading to generation of an oncogenic form of Notch1 in the tumors. This finding suggests that the molecular basis for hypomethylation-induced tumors in this model involves chromosomal instability events accompanied by activation of endogenous retroviral elements. Our findings validate the proposed role of DNA methylation in suppression of transposable elements in mammalian cells and demonstrate the importance of DNA methylation for normal cell function as well as the potential consequences of spontaneously occurring or chemically induced DNA hypomethylation.},

Two frameshift mutants were derived from this vector such that the neo and the hygro genes were inactivated in separate vectors. Thus, each vector confers resistance to only one selection. The vectors with frameshift mutations were separately propagated and were pooled to infect DSDh helper cells. Doubly resistant cell clones were isolated, and viruses produced from these clones were used to infect D17 cells. This protocol allowed virions containing two different genomic RNAs (heterozygotes) to complete one round of retroviral replication. The molecular nature of progeny that conferred resistance to single or double selection and their ratio were determined. Our data demonstrate that each infectious heterozygous virion produces only one provirus. The rate of retroviral recombination is approximately 2\% per kilobase per replication cycle. Recombinant proviruses are progeny of heterozygous virions.},

Analysis of retroviral recombinants formed after a single round of replication revealed that (i) the nonselected markers changed more frequently than expected from the rate of recombination of selected markers; (ii) the transfer of the initially synthesized minus strand strong stop DNA was either intramolecular or intermolecular; (iii) the transfer of the first synthesized plus strand strong stop DNA was always intramolecular; and (iv) there was a strong correlation between the type of transfer of the minus strand strong stop DNA and the number of template switches observed.

Even with optimal HAART treatment, replication-competent HIV-1 still exists in resting primary CD4+ T cells. Multiple restriction factors that act upon various steps of the viral life cycle could contribute to viral latency. Here we show that cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) potently inhibit HIV-1 production in resting primary CD4+ T cells. We have found that the 3' ends of HIV-1 messenger RNAs are targeted by a cluster of cellular miRNAs including miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223 and miR-382, which are enriched in resting CD4+ T cells as compared to activated CD4+ T cells. Specific inhibitors of these miRNAs substantially counteracted their effects on the target mRNAs, measured either as HIV-1 protein translation in resting CD4+ T cells transfected with HIV-1 infectious clones, or as HIV-1 virus production from resting CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive HAART. Our data indicate that cellular miRNAs are pivotal in HIV-1 latency and suggest that manipulation of cellular miRNAs could be a novel approach for purging the HIV-1 reservoir.},

Coreceptor use by non-subtype B HIV is less well characterized. We studied coreceptor tropism of subtype A and D HIV-1 collected from 68 pregnant, antiretroviral drug-naive Ugandan women (HIVNET 012 trial). None of 33 subtype A or 10 A/D-recombinant viruses used the CXCR4 coreceptor. In contrast, nine (36\%) of 25 subtype D viruses used both CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors. Clonal analyses of the nine subtype D samples with dual or mixed tropism revealed heterogeneous viral populations comprised of X4-, R5-, and dual-tropic HIV-1 variants. In five of the six samples with dual-tropic strains, V3 loop sequences of dual-tropic clones were identical to those of cocirculating R5-tropic clones, indicating the presence of CXCR4 tropism determinants outside of the V3 loop. These dual-tropic variants with R5-tropic-like V3 loops, which we designated "dual-R," use CCR5 much more efficiently than CXCR4, in contrast to dual-tropic clones with X4-tropic-like V3 loops ("dual-X"). These observations have implications for pathogenesis and treatment of subtype D-infected individuals, for the association between V3 sequence and coreceptor tropism phenotype, and for understanding potential mechanisms of evolution from exclusive CCR5 use to efficient CXCR4 use by subtype D HIV-1.},

Here, we present a comprehensive study to elucidate how heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins, among the most abundant RNA binding proteins, coordinate to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in human cells. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), and cDNA sequencing, we find that more than half of all AS events are regulated by multiple hnRNP proteins and that some combinations of hnRNP proteins exhibit significant synergy, whereas others act antagonistically. Our analyses reveal position-dependent RNA splicing maps, in vivo consensus binding sites, a surprising level of cross- and autoregulation among hnRNP proteins, and the coordinated regulation by hnRNP proteins of dozens of other RNA binding proteins and genes associated with cancer. Our findings define an unprecedented degree of complexity and compensatory relationships among hnRNP proteins and their splicing targets that likely confer robustness to cells.},

While none of these viruses is a replica of HIV-1, the macaque and mangabey viruses represent correct genetic models for HIV-2, possessing exactly the same complement of genes. Recently a lentivirus has been identified in two wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Gabon, west equatorial Africa, and isolated from one of them. This virus is referred to as SIVCPZ. Sera from these animals cross reacted with all the HIV-1 proteins including the envelope glycoproteins. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and sequencing of an infectious proviral clone of SIVCPZ. The overall genetic organization was the same as that of HIV-1, but phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequence was more divergent than any HIV-1 sequence reported so far. The vpu gene product, found only in the type 1 viruses, was particularly different (64\% divergent to HIV-1BRU) suggesting that the SIVCPZ represents a distinct subtype. These findings indicate that there is a larger pool of simian lentiviruses than previously suspected and revives debate as to the origins of HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {We have analyzed the DNA from 15 clones of avian sarcoma virus (ASV)-transformed rat cells with restriction endonucleases and molecular hybridization techniques to determine the location and structure of proviral DNA. All twenty units of proviral DNA identified in these 15 clones appear to be inserted at different sites in host DNA. In each of the ten cases that could be sufficiently well mapped, entirely different regions of cellular DNA were involved. Thus ASV DNA can be accommodated at many positions in cellular DNA, but the existence of preferred sites has not been excluded. Six of the 15 clones carry only one normal provirus, two contain two normal proviruses, and seven harbor either one or two proviruses that appear anomalous in physical mapping tests. Both ends of at least 18 proviruses, however, were found to contain sequences specific to both the 3' and 5' termini of viral RNA. The organization of these terminally redundant sequences appeared identical to that of the 300 base pair (bp) repeats found at the ends of unintegrated linear DNA (Shank et al., 1978). Proviral DNA is therefore co-extensive, or nearly co-extensive, with unintegrated linear DNA and has a structure we denote as CELL DNA-3'5'----------3'5'-CELL DNA. Three of the four anomalous proviruses which were fully analyzed were deletion mutants lacking 25--65\% of the genetic content of ASV; the fourth provirus had a novel site for cleavage by Eco RI but was otherwise normal. Tests for the biological competence of proviral DNA, based upon rescue of transforming virus after fusion with chicken cells, were generally consistent with the physical mapping studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The untranslated regions of mRNAs can determine gene expression by influencing mRNA stability and translational efficiency. Recent reports show that gene expression can be regulated by the differential use of alternative untranslated regions. Tissue-specific expression of transcripts that have different untranslated regions (UTRs) can control protein expression enabling developmental, physiological and pathological regulation. Several examples of alternative UTRs have been characterized, including those found in AXIN2, FGF1 and BRCA1. Results from bioinformatics studies indicate that this mechanism is more common than previously appreciated.},

Yet within the past two decades the prevalence has increased to the point that several hundred cases occur annually in the United States. The emergence of this infectious disease is probably related directly to the increased use of immunosuppressive therapy for diseases of somewhat unrelated causes. Organ-transplant recipients, patients with cancer and children with congenital immune deficiency disorders constitute the majority of patients at risk for the disease. In such cases, referred to here as the "child-adult type," the pneumonitis is an acute, fulminating and diffuse alveolopathy. The infection is usually fatal unless treated.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing of genes is an efficient means of generating variation in protein function. Several disease states have been associated with rare genetic variants that affect splicing patterns. Conversely, splicing efficiency of some genes is known to vary between individuals without apparent ill effects. What is not clear is whether commonly observed phenotypic variation in splicing patterns, and hence potential variation in protein function, is to a significant extent determined by naturally occurring DNA sequence variation and in particular by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this study, we surveyed the splicing patterns of 250 exons in 22 individuals who had been previously genotyped by the International HapMap Project. We identified 70 simple cassette exon alternative splicing events in our experimental system; for six of these, we detected consistent differences in splicing pattern between individuals, with a highly significant association between splice phenotype and neighbouring SNPs. Remarkably, for five out of six of these events, the strongest correlation was found with the SNP closest to the intron-exon boundary, although the distance between these SNPs and the intron-exon boundary ranged from 2 bp to greater than 1,000 bp. Two of these SNPs were further investigated using a minigene splicing system, and in each case the SNPs were found to exert cis-acting effects on exon splicing efficiency in vitro. The functional consequences of these SNPs could not be predicted using bioinformatic algorithms. Our findings suggest that phenotypic variation in splicing patterns is determined by the presence of SNPs within flanking introns or exons. Effects on splicing may represent an important mechanism by which SNPs influence gene function.},

  Abstract                 = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of hypervariable regions from small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes can sample a microbial community two or three orders of magnitude more deeply per dollar and per hour than capillary sequencing of full-length SSU rRNA. As with full-length rRNA surveys, each sequence read is a tag surrogate for a single microbe. However, rather than assigning taxonomy by creating gene trees de novo that include all experimental sequences and certain reference taxa, we compare the hypervariable region tags to an extensive database of rRNA sequences and assign taxonomy based on the best match in a Global Alignment for Sequence Taxonomy (GAST) process. The resulting taxonomic census provides information on both composition and diversity of the microbial community. To determine the effectiveness of using only hypervariable region tags for assessing microbial community membership, we compared the taxonomy assigned to the V3 and V6 hypervariable regions with the taxonomy assigned to full-length SSU rRNA sequences isolated from both the human gut and a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The hypervariable region tags and full-length rRNA sequences provided equivalent taxonomy and measures of relative abundance of microbial communities, even for tags up to 15% divergent from their nearest reference match. The greater sampling depth per dollar afforded by massively parallel pyrosequencing reveals many more members of the “rare biosphere” than does capillary sequencing of the full-length gene. In addition, tag sequencing eliminates cloning bias and the sequences are short enough to be completely sequenced in a single read, maximizing the number of organisms sampled in a run while minimizing chimera formation. This technique allows the cost-effective exploration of changes in microbial community structure, including the rare biosphere, over space and time and can be applied immediately to initiatives, such as the Human Microbiome Project.},

In genome projects, highly redundant consensus assemblies can compensate for sequencing errors. In contrast, studies of microbial diversity that catalogue differences between PCR amplicons of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) or other conserved gene families cannot take advantage of consensus assemblies to detect and minimize incorrect base calls.RESULTS:We performed an empirical study of the per-base error rate for the Roche GS20 system using sequences of the V6 hypervariable region from cloned microbial ribosomal DNA (tag sequencing). We calculated a 99.5% accuracy rate in unassembled sequences, and identified several factors that can be used to remove a small percentage of low-quality reads, improving the accuracy to 99.75% or better.CONCLUSION:By using objective criteria to eliminate low quality data, the quality of individual GS20 sequence reads in molecular ecological applications can surpass the accuracy of traditional capillary methods.},

  Abstract                 = {A promising sliding-window method for the detection of interspecific recombination in DNA sequence alignments is based on the monitoring of changes in the posterior distribution of tree topologies with a probabilistic divergence measure. However, as the number of taxa in the alignment increases or the sliding-window size decreases, the posterior distribution becomes increasingly diffuse. This diffusion blurs the probabilistic divergence signal and adversely affects the detection accuracy. The present study investigates how this shortcoming can be redeemed with a pruning method based on post-processing clustering, using the Robinson-Foulds distance as a metric in tree topology space.An application of the proposed scheme to three synthetic and two real-world DNA sequence alignments illustrates the amount of improvement that can be obtained with the pruning method. The study also includes a comparison with two established recombination detection methods: Recpars and the DSS (difference of sum of squares) method.Software, data and further supplementary material are available at the following website: http://www.bioss.sari.ac.uk/~dirk/Supplements/},

Data from the HIV/AIDS Reporting System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to determine stage of disease at diagnosis and proportion of cases by race/ethnicity. Lifetime direct medical costs and mortality-related productivity losses were estimated using data on cost, life expectancy, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use from the literature.The cost of new HIV infections in the United States in 2002 is estimated at $36.4 billion, including $6.7 billion in direct medical costs and $29.7 billion in productivity losses. Direct medical costs per case were highest for whites ($180,900) and lowest for blacks ($160,400). Productivity losses per case were lowest for whites ($661,100) and highest for Hispanics ($838,000). In a sensitivity analysis, universal use of ART and more effective ART regimens decreased the overall cost of illness.Direct medical costs and productivity losses of HIV/AIDS resulting from infections diagnosed in 2002 are substantial. Productivity losses far surpass direct medical costs and are disproportionately borne by minority races/ethnicities. Our analysis underscores economic benefits of more effective ART regimens and universal access to ART.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in T-cell function are a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but the pathogenic mechanisms leading to these changes are unclear. We examined the gene expression profiles in ex vivo human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from untreated HIV-1-infected individuals at different clinical stages and rates of disease progression. Profiles of pure CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets from HIV-1-infected nonprogressors with controlled viremia were indistinguishable from those of individuals not infected with HIV-1. Similarly, no gene clusters could distinguish T cells from individuals with early infection from those seen in chronic progressive HIV-1 infection, whereas differences were observed between uninfected individuals or nonprogressors versus early or chronic progressors. In early and chronic HIV-1 infection, three characteristic gene expression signatures were observed. (i) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, some ISGs, including CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, and the interleukin-15 alpha receptor were not upregulated. (ii) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed a cluster similar to that observed in thymocytes. (iii) More genes were differentially regulated in CD8+ T cells than in CD4+ T cells, including a cluster of genes downregulated exclusively in CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, HIV-1 infection induces a persistent T-cell transcriptional profile, early in infection, characterized by a dramatic but potentially aberrant interferon response and a profile suggesting an active thymic output. These findings highlight the complexity of the host-virus relationship in HIV-1 infection.},

The study was designed to test the Merck's MRKAd5 trivalent candidate vaccine. The vaccine formulation was expected to stimulate a HIV-specific T cell immune response and to either prevent infection, or to reduce the levels of the viral load in vaccinated subjects. Upon the first evaluation of the interim data, the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) underscored no protection from HIV-1 infection in the vaccine-inoculated volunteers compared with the control group; accordingly, the vaccine trial was stopped. This disappointing outcome warrants a critical analysis of the current vaccine studies and calls for a renewed effort toward a rational design of novel immunogens to be tested in large primate trials.},

Here we examine (meta)genomic data available in the decade since this provocative assertion, and use 'protein clusters' to evaluate whether sampling technologies have advanced to the point that we may be able to sample 'all' of viral diversity in nature.},

To determine the contribution of integration sites to viral latency within clinical settings, an inverse polymerase chain reaction method was used to analyze integration sites in CD4(+) T cells from patients showing long-term undetectable plasma viral RNA. Of 457 sites identified in 7 patients, almost all (96\%) resided within transcriptional units, usually in introns of the human genome. Studies of 18 genes in which HIV-1 integrates found them to be actively expressed in resting CD4(+) T cells. On the other hand, integration sites in the alpha satellite region was also identified in some patients, albeit at low frequency. Of particular interest, HIV-1-infected cells with multiple identical integration sites were detected in longitudinal analysis of samples from 3 patients, suggesting that these cells persist for long periods and that clonal expansion may occur. Furthermore, strong integration clusters in the BACH2 gene were observed in 2 patients (31\% in patient 1 and 5\% in patient 3). Our findings not only raise the possibility of biased target-site integration but also provide mechanistic insights into the long-term persistence of HIV-1.},

As the percentage of HIV-1-infected cells is very low, most studies have so far failed to capture the precise transcriptomic profile at the whole-genome scale of cells highly susceptible to virus infection. Using Affymetrix Exon array technology and a reporter virus allowing the magnetic isolation of HIV-1-infected cells, we describe the host cell factors most favorable for virus establishment and replication along with an overview of virus-induced changes in host gene expression occurring exclusively in target cells productively infected with HIV-1. We also establish that within a population of activated CD4(+) T cells, HIV-1 has no detectable effect on the transcriptome of uninfected bystander cells at early time points following infection. The data gathered in this study provides unique insights into the biology of HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells and identifies genes thought to play a determinant role in the interplay between the virus and its host. Furthermore, it provides the first catalogue of alternative splicing events found in primary human CD4(+) T cells productively infected with HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 infection in cell lines is very efficient, since the target population is clonal and highly dividing. However, infection of primary cells such as CD4 T lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages is much more difficult, resulting in a very small percentage of infected cells. In order to study events occurring in productively infected primary cells, we determined that a way to isolate this population from bystander cells was needed. We engineered a novel HIV-1-based reporter virus called NL4-3-IRES-HSA that allows for the magnetic separation of cells infected with fully competent virions. This X4-using virus encodes for the heat-stable antigen (HSA/murine CD24) without the deletion of any viral genes by introducing an IRES sequence between HSA and the auxiliary gene Nef. Using commercial magnetic beads, we achieved efficient purification of HIV-1-infected cells (i.e. purity >85\% and recovery >90\%) from diverse primary cell types at early time points following infection. We used this system to accurately quantify p53 protein levels in both virus-infected and uninfected bystander primary CD4(+) T cells. We show that p53 up-regulation occurs exclusively in the infected population. We devised a strategy that allows for an efficient separation of HIV-1 infected cells from bystanders. We believe that this new reporter virus system will be of great help to study in depth how HIV-1 interacts with its host in a primary cells context.},

  Abstract                 = {Infection with HIV-1 has been shown to alter expression of a large array of host cell genes. However, previous studies aimed at investigating the putative HIV-1-induced modulation of host gene expression have been mostly performed in established human cell lines. To better approximate natural conditions, we monitored gene expression changes in a cell population highly enriched in human primary CD4+ T lymphocytes exposed to HIV-1 using commercial oligonucleotide microarrays from Affymetrix.We report here that HIV-1 influences expression of genes related to many important biological processes such as DNA repair, cellular cycle, RNA metabolism and apoptosis. Notably, expression of the p53 tumor suppressor and genes involved in p53 homeostasis such as GADD34 were up-regulated by HIV-1 at the mRNA level. This observation is distinct from the previously reported p53 phosphorylation and stabilization at the protein level, which precedes HIV-1-induced apoptosis. We present evidence that the HIV-1-mediated increase in p53 gene expression is associated with virus-mediated induction of type-I interferon (i.e. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta).These observations have important implications for our understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis, particularly in respect to the virus-induced depletion of CD4+ T cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Techniques for systematically monitoring protein translation have lagged far behind methods for measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Here, we present a ribosome-profiling strategy that is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and enables genome-wide investigation of translation with subcodon resolution. We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences being translated and found extensive translational control in both determining absolute protein abundance and responding to environmental stress. We also observed distinct phases during translation that involve a large decrease in ribosome density going from early to late peptide elongation as well as widespread regulated initiation at non-adenine-uracil-guanine (AUG) codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation experimentally accessible.},

Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.},

  Abstract                 = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of alternative splicing (AS) in eliciting immune responses is poorly understood. We used quantitative AS microarray profiling to survey changes in AS during activation of Jurkat cells, a leukemia-derived T-cell line. Our results indicate that approximately 10-15\% of the profiled alternative exons undergo a >10\% change in inclusion level during activation. The majority of the genes displaying differential AS levels are distinct from the set of genes displaying differential transcript levels. These two gene sets also have overlapping yet distinct functional roles. For example, genes that show differential AS patterns during T-cell activation are often closely associated with cell-cycle regulation, whereas genes with differential transcript levels are highly enriched in functions associated more directly with immune defense and cytoskeletal architecture. Previously unknown AS events were detected in genes that have important roles in T-cell activation, and these AS level changes were also observed during the activation of normal human peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. In summary, by using AS microarray profiling, we have discovered many new AS changes associated with T-cell activation. Our results suggest an extensive role for AS in the regulation of the mammalian immune response.},

Estimates suggest that these elements have generated millions of new germline insertions in individual human genomes worldwide. Unfortunately, current technologies are not capable of detecting most of these young insertions, and the true extent of germline mutagenesis by endogenous human retrotransposons has been difficult to examine. Here, we describe technologies for detecting these young retrotransposon insertions and demonstrate that such insertions indeed are abundant in human populations. We also found that new somatic L1 insertions occur at high frequencies in human lung cancer genomes. Genome-wide analysis suggests that altered DNA methylation may be responsible for the high levels of L1 mobilization observed in these tumors. Our data indicate that transposon-mediated mutagenesis is extensive in human genomes and is likely to have a major impact on human biology and diseases.},

Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {E2F is a heterodimeric transcription factor that controls transcription of several growth-regulatory genes including cdc2. To investigate the mechanism of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-mediated growth suppression of hematopoietic cells, we examined the effect of IFN-alpha on the expression and function of E2F using IFN-sensitive Daudi cells. Down-regulation of E2F-1, a subunit of E2F, was observed after 8 h of culture with IFN-alpha; expression of E2F-4, another subunit of E2F, and DP-1, a heterodimeric partner of E2F, was unaffected. Gel shift assays revealed that the DNA binding activity of free E2F, which is composed of E2F-1 and E2F-4, was inhibited by IFN-alpha. In contrast, IFN-alpha did not affect the DNA binding ability of E2F-1 and E2F-4 in a complex with retinoblastoma (RB) susceptibility gene family proteins including pRB, p107, and p130. IFN-alpha could induce dephosphorylation of pRB, thereby turning active E2F-pRB complexes into transcriptional repressors. Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays revealed that the activity of the E2F-dependent cdc2 promoter was suppressed by IFN-alpha. These results suggest that the antiproliferative action of IFN-alpha is mediated through the modulation of E2F activity in two different ways: down-regulation of transcriptionally active free E2F and conversion of E2F-pRB complexes into transcriptional repressors.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a small genome and therefore relies heavily on the host cellular machinery to replicate. Identifying which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how HIV rewires the host's cellular machinery during the course of infection. Here we report the use of affinity tagging and purification mass spectrometry to determine systematically the physical interactions of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two different human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with ∼40\% of the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. This host protein is one of eleven identified in this analysis that act to inhibit HIV replication. This data set facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is manipulated during the course of HIV infection.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 gene expression requires both viral and cellular factors to control and coordinate transcription. While the viral factor Tat is known for its transcriptional transactivator properties, we present evidence for an unexpected function of Tat in viral splicing regulation. We used a series of HIV-1 reporter minigenes to demonstrate that Tat's role in splicing is dependent on the cellular co-transcriptional splicing activators Tat-SF1 and CA150. Surprisingly, we show that this Tat-mediated splicing function is independent from transcriptional activation. In the context of the full-length viral genome, this mechanism promotes an autoregulatory feedback that decreases expression of tat and favors expression of the env-specific mRNA. Our data demonstrate that Tat-mediated regulation of transcription and splicing can be uncoupled and suggest a mechanism for the involvement of specific transcriptional activators in splicing.},

In this work, we show that, in the context of the wild-type viral sequence, hnRNP H acts as a repressor of exon 6D inclusion independent of its binding to the SRE. However, hnRNP H binding to the SRE acts as an enhancer of exon 6D inclusion in the presence of a critical T-to-C mutation. These seemingly contrasting functional properties of hnRNP H appear to be caused by a change in the RNA secondary structure induced by the T-to-C mutation that affects the spatial location of bound hnRNP H with respect to the exon 6D splicing determinants. We propose a new regulatory mechanism mediated by RNA folding that may also explain the dual properties of hnRNP H in splicing regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome requires several cellular factors regulating transcription, alternative splicing, RNA stability, and intracellular localization of the viral transcripts. In vitro and ex vivo approaches have identified SR proteins and hnRNPs of the A/B and H subfamilies as cellular factors that regulate different aspects of viral mRNA metabolism. To understand the role of these protein families within the context of the full replicating virus, we altered the expression levels of hnRNPs H, F, 2H9, GRSF1, A1, A2, and A3 and SR proteins SC35, SF2, and SRp40 in HEK 293 cells transfected with the proviral clone pNL4-3. Quantitative and semiquantitative PCR analyses showed that overexpression as well as downregulation of these proteins disrupted the balance of alternatively spliced viral mRNAs and may alter viral transcription. Furthermore, expression of hnRNPs H, F, 2H9, A1, and A2 and SR proteins SF2 and SRp40 increased nuclear localization of the unspliced Gag/Pol mRNA, while the same factors increased the cytoplasmic localization of the partially spliced Env mRNA. We also report that overexpression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 and SR proteins SF2, SC35, and SRp40 causes a dramatic decrease in virion production. Finally, utilizing a reporter TZM-bl cell line, we show that virion infectivity may be also impacted by deregulation of expression of most SR proteins and hnRNPs. This work demonstrates that cellular factors regulating mRNA processing have wide-ranging effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication and should be considered novel therapeutic targets.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on precedents from other retroviruses, the precursor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase is predicted to be a polyprotein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 160,000 (160K) encoded by both the viral pol gene and the upstream gag gene. These two genes lie in different translational reading frames, with the 3' end of gag overlapping the 5' end of pol by 205 or 241 nucleotides. Thus, production of the gag-pol fusion protein would require either messenger RNA processing or translational frameshifting. The latter mechanism has been shown in the synthesis of the gag-pol proteins of two other retroviruses, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). Here we report that translation of HIV-1 RNA synthesized in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase yields significant amounts of a gag-pol fusion protein, indicating that efficient ribosomal frameshifting also occurs within the HIV-1 gag-pol overlap region. Site-directed mutagenesis and amino-acid sequencing localized the site of frameshifting to a UUA leucine codon near the 5' end of the overlap.},

  Abstract                 = {In HIV-1 infected cells transcription of the integrated provirus generates the single full length 9 kb viral RNA, a major fraction of which is spliced to produce the single-spliced 4 kb RNAs and the multiple-spliced 2 kb RNAs. These spliced RNAs are the messengers for the Env glycoproteins and the viral regulatory factors. The cellular SR and hnRNP proteins were shown in vitro to control alternative splicing by binding cis-regulatory elements on the viral RNA. To better understand in vivo the role of the SR proteins on HIV-1 genomic RNA splicing and virion production, we used a human cell line expressing high levels of complete HIV-1 and either one of the ASF/SF2, SC35, and 9G8 SR proteins. Results show that over-expressing SR proteins caused a large reduction of genomic RNA and that each SR protein modified the viral 9 kb RNA splicing pattern in a specific mode. In fact, ASF/SF2 increased the level of Vpr RNA while SC35 and 9G8 caused a large increase in Tat RNA. As expected, overexpressing SR proteins caused a strong reduction of total Gag made. However, we observed by immuno-confocal microscopy an accumulation of Gag at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments while there is a dramatic reduction of Env protein made in most cells. Due to the negative impact of the SR proteins on the levels of genomic RNA and HIV-1 structural proteins much less virions were produced which retained part of their infectivity. In conclusion, SR proteins can down-regulate the late steps of HIV-1 replication.},

In this article, we develop a method to deal with the isoform expression estimation problem. The count of reads falling into a locus on the genome annotated with multiple isoforms is modeled as a Poisson variable. The expression of each individual isoform is estimated by solving a convex optimization problem and statistical inferences about the parameters are obtained from the posterior distribution by importance sampling. Our results show that isoform expression inference in RNA-Seq is possible by employing appropriate statistical methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically decreased mortality from HIV-1 infection and is a major achievement of modern medicine. However, there is no fundamental theory of HAART. Elegant models describe the dynamics of viral replication, but a metric for the antiviral activity of drug combinations relative to a target value needed for control of replication is lacking. Treatment guidelines are based on empirical results of clinical trials in which other factors such as regimen tolerability also affect outcome. Why only certain drug combinations control viral replication remains unclear. Here we quantify the intrinsic antiviral activity of antiretroviral drug combinations. We show that most single antiretroviral drugs show previously unappreciated complex nonlinear pharmacodynamics that determine their inhibitory potential at clinical concentrations. We demonstrate that neither of the major theories for drug combinations accurately predicts the combined effects of multiple antiretrovirals. However, the combined effects can be understood with a new approach that considers the degree of independence of drug effects. This analysis allows a direct comparison of the inhibitory potential of different drug combinations under clinical concentrations, reconciles the results of clinical trials, defines a target level of inhibition associated with treatment success and provides a rational basis for treatment simplification and optimization.},

To understand the biological roles and regulation of alternative splicing across different tissues and stages of development, systematic methods are needed. Here, we demonstrate the use of microarrays to monitor splicing at every exon-exon junction in more than 10,000 multi-exon human genes in 52 tissues and cell lines. These genome-wide data provide experimental evidence and tissue distributions for thousands of known and novel alternative splicing events. Adding to previous studies, the results indicate that at least 74\% of human multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced.},

  Abstract                 = {Few estimates exist of the life expectancy of HIV-positive adults receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to estimate the life expectancy of patients starting ART in South Africa and compare it with that of HIV-negative adults.Data were collected from six South African ART cohorts. Analysis was restricted to 37,740 HIV-positive adults starting ART for the first time. Estimates of mortality were obtained by linking patient records to the national population register. Relative survival models were used to estimate the excess mortality attributable to HIV by age, for different baseline CD4 categories and different durations. Non-HIV mortality was estimated using a South African demographic model. The average life expectancy of men starting ART varied between 27.6 y (95\% CI: 25.2-30.2) at age 20 y and 10.1 y (95\% CI: 9.3-10.8) at age 60 y, while estimates for women at the same ages were substantially higher, at 36.8 y (95\% CI: 34.0-39.7) and 14.4 y (95\% CI: 13.3-15.3), respectively. The life expectancy of a 20-y-old woman was 43.1 y (95\% CI: 40.1-46.0) if her baseline CD4 count was ≥ 200 cells/µl, compared to 29.5 y (95\% CI: 26.2-33.0) if her baseline CD4 count was <50 cells/µl. Life expectancies of patients with baseline CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/µl were between 70\% and 86\% of those in HIV-negative adults of the same age and sex, and life expectancies were increased by 15\%-20\% in patients who had survived 2 y after starting ART. However, the analysis was limited by a lack of mortality data at longer durations.South African HIV-positive adults can have a near-normal life expectancy, provided that they start ART before their CD4 count drops below 200 cells/µl. These findings demonstrate that the near-normal life expectancies of HIV-positive individuals receiving ART in high-income countries can apply to low- and middle-income countries as well.

  Abstract                 = {Nucleosome positions within the chromatin landscape are known to serve as a major determinant of DNA accessibility to transcription factors and other interacting components. To delineate nucleosomal patterns in a model genetic organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis in which DNA fragments corresponding to nucleosome cores were liberated using an enzyme (micrococcal nuclease) with a strong preference for cleavage in non-nucleosomal regions. Sequence analysis of 284,091 putative nucleosome cores obtained in this manner from a mixed-stage population of C. elegans reveals a combined picture of flexibility and constraint in nucleosome positioning. As has previously been observed in studies of individual loci in diverse biological systems, we observe areas in the genome where nucleosomes can adopt a wide variety of positions in a given region, areas with little or no nucleosome coverage, and areas where nucleosomes reproducibly adopt a specific positional pattern. In addition to illuminating numerous aspects of chromatin structure for C. elegans, this analysis provides a reference from which to begin an investigation of relationships between the nucleosomal pattern, chromosomal architecture, and lineage-based gene activity on a genome-wide scale.},

Zidovudine (AZT, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), didanosine (ddI, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine), and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were evaluated in two-drug regimens against replication of AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro. AZT-sensitive and AZT-resistant isolate pairs derived from two individuals before and after extended AZT monotherapy were studied. Drug interactions using peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1 were evaluated mathematically. Synergistic interactions were seen among AZT, ddI, and rIFN-alpha A in two-drug regimens against AZT-resistant HIV-1 in vitro, even when AZT was included in the treatment regimen. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant reverse transcriptase genes were found in one of the late-AZT therapy isolates, suggesting that the mechanism of synergy of AZT-containing regimens may involve inhibition of AZT-sensitive viruses in the viral pool. These studies suggest that AZT may be useful in drug combination regimens, even when AZT-resistant viruses are isolated in vitro.},

  Abstract                 = {IFI 16 is a member of a family of interferon-inducible proteins, including the human MNDA (myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen), the recently identified AIM-2 (absent in melanoma), and the homologous murine molecules, p202, p204, and D3. IFI 16 contains a domain at the amino terminus capable of binding double-stranded DNA and a bipartite nuclear localization signal. No molecular or biological function has been assigned to any of the human family members, although a role in transcription regulation has been proposed. In the present study, we show IFI 16 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain can function as a transcriptional repressor. IFI 16-mediated repression is not dependent on the position or distance of IFI 16 binding, relative to the site of transcription initiation, and it can significantly repress when only one GAL4 DNA element is present in the promoter. We mapped the transcriptional repression domains to the 200 amino acid repeat regions common to all human and mouse family members. We also demonstrate that wild type IFI 16 can repress transcription of a reporter gene containing the minimal promoter region of the human cytomegalovirus UL54 gene. Thus, IFI 16 is a transcriptional repressor, with a modular structure typical of many known transcription regulators.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic diversity of HIV-1 represents a major challenge in vaccine development. In this study, we establish a rationale for eliminating HIV-1-infected cells by targeting cellular immune responses against stable human endogenous retroviral (HERV) antigens. HERV DNA sequences in the human genome represent the remnants of ancient infectious retroviruses. We show that the infection of CD4+ T cells with HIV-1 resulted in transcription of the HML-2 lineage of HERV type K [HERV-K(HML-2)] and the expression of Gag and Env proteins. HERV-K(HML-2)-specific CD8+ T cells obtained from HIV-1-infected human subjects responded to HIV-1-infected cells in a Vif-dependent manner in vitro. Consistent with the proposed mode of action, a HERV-K(HML-2)-specific CD8+ T cell clone exhibited comprehensive elimination of cells infected with a panel of globally diverse HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV isolates in vitro. We identified a second T cell response that exhibited cross-reactivity between homologous HIV-1-Pol and HERV-K(HML-2)-Pol determinants, raising the possibility that homology between HIV-1 and HERVs plays a role in shaping, and perhaps enhancing, the T cell response to HIV-1. This justifies the consideration of HERV-K(HML-2)-specific and cross-reactive T cell responses in the natural control of HIV-1 infection and for exploring HERV-K(HML-2)-targeted HIV-1 vaccines and immunotherapeutics.},

  Abstract                 = {Type 1 long-interspersed nuclear elements (L1s) are autonomous retrotransposable elements that retain the potential for activity in the human genome but are suppressed by host factors. Retrotransposition of L1s into chromosomal DNA can lead to genomic instability, whereas reverse transcription of L1 in the cytosol has the potential to activate innate immune sensors. We hypothesized that HIV-1 infection would compromise cellular control of L1 elements, resulting in the induction of retrotransposition events. Here, we show that HIV-1 infection enhances L1 retrotransposition in Jurkat cells in a Vif- and Vpr-dependent manner. In primary CD4(+) cells, HIV-1 infection results in the accumulation of L1 DNA, at least the majority of which is extrachromosomal. These data expose an unrecognized interaction between HIV-1 and endogenous retrotransposable elements, which may have implications for the innate immune response to HIV-1 infection, as well as for HIV-1-induced genomic instability and cytopathicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid rebound of plasma viremia in patients after interruption of long-term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suggests persistence of low-level replicating cells or rapid reactivation of latently infected cells. To further characterize rebounding virus, we performed extensive longitudinal clonal evolutionary studies of HIV env C2-V3-C3 regions and exploited the temporal relationships of rebounding plasma viruses with regard to pretreatment sequences in 20 chronically HIV-1-infected patients having undergone multiple 2-week structured treatment interruptions (STI). Rebounding virus during the short STI was homogeneous, suggesting mono- or oligoclonal origin during reactivation. No evidence for a temporal structure of rebounding virus in regard to pretreatment sequences was found. Furthermore, expansion of distinct lineages at different STI cycles emerged. Together, these findings imply stochastic reactivation of different clones from long-lived latently infected cells rather than expansion of viral populations replicating at low levels. After treatment was stopped, diversity increased steadily, but pretreatment diversity was, on average, achieved only >2.5 years after the start of STI when marked divergence from preexisting quasispecies also emerged. In summary, our results argue against persistence of ongoing low-level replication in patients on suppressive cART. Furthermore, a prolonged delay in restoration of pretreatment viral diversity after treatment interruption demonstrates a surprisingly sustained evolutionary bottleneck induced by punctuated antiretroviral therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {The presence of latent reservoirs has prevented the eradication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from infected patients successfully treated with anti-retroviral therapy. The mechanism of postintegration latency is poorly understood, partly because of the lack of an in vitro model. We have used an HIV retroviral vector or a full-length HIV genome expressing green fluorescent protein to infect a T lymphocyte cell line in vitro and highly enrich for latently infected cells. HIV latency occurred reproducibly, albeit with low frequency, during an acute infection. Clonal cell lines derived from latent populations showed no detectable basal expression, but could be transcriptionally activated after treatment with phorbol esters or tumor necrosis factor alpha. Direct sequencing of integration sites demonstrated that latent clones frequently contain HIV integrated in or close to alphoid repeat elements in heterochromatin. This is in contrast to a productive infection where integration in or near heterochromatin is disfavored. These observations demonstrate that HIV can reproducibly establish a latent infection as a consequence of integration in or near heterochromatin.},

We have used an HIV-1-derived retroviral vector, in which the green fluorescent protein is under the control of the HIV promoter, to generate by infection 34 Jurkat clonal cell lines each containing a single integration of the HIV-1 vector. In the absence of Tat, a 75-fold difference in expression level between the highest and lowest expressing clones was observed. Basal promoter activity was low in 80\% of the clones and moderate to high in the remaining 20\% of clones. We found that differences in expression levels are due to the integration site and are not controlled by DNA methylation or histone acetylation. Tat activated transcription in each clone, and an inverse correlation was observed between basal transcriptional activity and inducibility by Tat. These observations demonstrate that the chromatin environment influences basal HIV gene expression and that the HIV Tat protein activates transcription independently of the chromatin environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes profound immunological defects in afflicted patients. Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the immune dysfunction in AIDS ultimately leading to loss of CD4+ T cells, including HIV-1 envelope-mediated syncytium formation, apoptosis, and cytokine modulation. Here we present results which suggest a novel hypothesis for T-cell dysfunction. We show, using HIV-1 bearing a novel cell surface reporter gene, that infected cells are unable to progress normally through the cell cycle and became arrested in the G2 + M phase. Furthermore, we identify the HIV-1 vpr gene product as being both necessary and sufficient for eliciting this cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest induced by Vpr correlates with an increase in the hyperphosphorylated (inactive) form of the cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinase CDC2, consistent with an arrest of cells at the boundary of G2 and M.},

Using a typical cycling program the rates of recombination between the two restriction sites were 1 and 7\% using Taq and Vent polymerases respectively over 12 doublings. However, by using long elongation times and cycling only to the mid-point of the amplification recombination could be suppressed below visual detection with both polymerases.

  Abstract                 = {Choroideremia (CHM) is essential for the posttranslational activation of retina-specific Rab protein. Transcript variants (a and b) of the CHM gene were detected in human cancer cells and tissues. Sequence analysis of the both variants found that isoform b is caused by an LTR12C element offering an alternative splicing site within the CHM gene. We performed real-time RT-PCR analysis to study expression levels of the CHM transcript variants in tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. Our results showed that CHM isoform b was highly expressed in tumor tissues but its expression levels were relatively low in those of adjacent normal tissues including colon, testis, and lung. In addition, high expression levels of CHM isoform b were detected in the cancer cell lines of colon and lung, and colon cancer patient tissues. Thus, we suggest that expression levels of alternative transcripts of the CHM gene could be used as a molecular marker system to identify human cancers.},

Here, we combined genome-wide siRNA analyses with interrogation of human interactome databases to assemble a host-pathogen biochemical network containing 213 confirmed host cellular factors and 11 HIV-1-encoded proteins. Protein complexes that regulate ubiquitin conjugation, proteolysis, DNA-damage response, and RNA splicing were identified as important modulators of early-stage HIV-1 infection. Additionally, over 40 new factors were shown to specifically influence the initiation and/or kinetics of HIV-1 DNA synthesis, including cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, modulators of posttranslational modification, and nucleic acid-binding proteins. Finally, 15 proteins with diverse functional roles, including nuclear transport, prostaglandin synthesis, ubiquitination, and transcription, were found to influence nuclear import or viral DNA integration. Taken together, the multiscale approach described here has uncovered multiprotein virus-host interactions that likely act in concert to facilitate the early steps of HIV-1 infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Although zidovudine is effective in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, its efficacy may decline with prolonged use. Didanosine is another inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. We evaluated the effectiveness of changing anti-HIV treatment from zidovudine to didanosine.This multicenter, double-blind study involved 913 patients who had tolerated zidovudine for at least 16 weeks. The patients had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related complex with less than or equal to 300 CD4 cells per cubic milliliter, or asymptomatic HIV infection with less than or equal to 200 CD4 cells per cubic milliliter. They were randomly assigned to receive 600 mg per day of zidovudine, 750 mg per day of didanosine, or 500 mg per day of didanosine.There were significantly fewer new AIDS-defining events and deaths among the 298 subjects assigned to 500 mg per day of didanosine than among the subjects who continued to receive zidovudine (relative risk, 1.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.82; P = 0.015). With 750 mg of didanosine, there was no clear benefit over zidovudine (relative risk, 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.42). The efficacy of didanosine was unrelated to the duration of previous zidovudine treatment. In the two didanosine groups, there were improvements in the number of CD4 cells (P less than 0.001 for both groups) and in p24 antigen levels (P = 0.03 in the 500-mg group; P = 0.005 in the 750-mg group), as compared with the zidovudine group.Changing treatment from zidovudine to 500 mg per day of didanosine appears to slow the progression of HIV disease.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, high-quality catalogs of recurrently mutated cancer genes are becoming available for many cancer types. Increasing access to sequencing technology, including bench-top sequencers, provide the opportunity to re-sequence a limited set of cancer genes across a patient cohort with limited processing time. Here, we re-sequenced a set of cancer genes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using Nimblegen sequence capture coupled with Roche/454 technology. First, we investigated how a maximal sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection can be achieved through a benchmark study. We tested nine combinations of different mapping and variant-calling methods, varied the variant calling parameters, and compared the predicted mutations with a large independent validation set obtained by capillary re-sequencing. We found that the combination of two mapping algorithms, namely BWA-SW and SSAHA2, coupled with the variant calling algorithm Atlas-SNP2 yields the highest sensitivity (95\%) and the highest specificity (93\%). Next, we applied this analysis pipeline to identify mutations in a set of 58 cancer genes, in a panel of 18 T-ALL cell lines and 15 T-ALL patient samples. We confirmed mutations in known T-ALL drivers, including PHF6, NF1, FBXW7, NOTCH1, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN. Interestingly, we also found mutations in several cancer genes that had not been linked to T-ALL before, including JAK3. Finally, we re-sequenced a small set of 39 candidate genes and identified recurrent mutations in TET1, SPRY3 and SPRY4. In conclusion, we established an optimized analysis pipeline for Roche/454 data that can be applied to accurately detect gene mutations in cancer, which led to the identification of several new candidate T-ALL driver mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {Central Africa was the epicenter of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pandemic. Understanding the early epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, could provide insight into how HIV evolved and assist vaccine design and intervention efforts. Using enzyme immunosorbent assays, we tested 3,988 serum samples collected in Kinshasa in the mid-1980s and confirmed seroreactivity by Western blot. Polymerase chain reaction of gag p17, env C2V3C3, and/or gp41; DNA sequencing; and genetic analyses were performed. Gene regions representing all the HIV-1 group M clades and unclassifiable sequences were found. From two or three short gene regions, 37\% of the strains represented recombinant viruses, multiple infections, or both, which suggests that if whole genome sequences were available, most of these strains would have mosaic genomes. We propose that the HIV epidemic was well established in central Africa by the early 1980s and that some recombinant viruses most likely seeded the early global epidemic.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 Rev protein is a key component in the early to late switch in HIV-1 splicing from early intronless (e.g. tat, rev) to late intron-containing Rev-dependent (e.g. gag, vif, env) transcripts. Previous results suggested that cis-acting sequences and inefficient 5' and 3' splice sites are a prerequisite for Rev function. However, we and other groups have shown that two of the HIV-1 5' splice sites, D1 and D4, are efficiently used in vitro and in vivo. Here, we focus on the efficiency of the HIV-1 3' splice sites taking into consideration to what extent their intrinsic efficiencies are modulated by their downstream cis-acting exonic sequences. Furthermore, we delineate their role in RNA stabilization and Rev function.In the presence of an efficient upstream 5' splice site the integrity of the 3' splice site is not essential for Rev function whereas an efficient 3' splice site impairs Rev function. The detrimental effect of a strong 3' splice site on the amount of Rev-dependent intron-containing HIV-1 glycoprotein coding (env) mRNA is not compensatable by weakening the strength of the upstream 5' splice site. Swapping the HIV-1 3' splice sites in an RRE-containing minigene, we found a 3' splice site usage which was variably dependent on the presence of the usual downstream exonic sequence. The most evident activation of 3' splice site usage by its usual downstream exonic sequence was observed for 3' splice site A1 which was turned from an intrinsic very weak 3' splice site into the most active 3' splice site, even abolishing Rev activity. Performing pull-down experiments with nuclear extracts of HeLa cells we identified a novel ASF/SF2-dependent exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) within HIV-1 exon 2 consisting of a heptameric sequence motif occurring twice (M1 and M2) within this short non-coding leader exon. Single point mutation of M1 within an infectious molecular clone is detrimental for HIV-1 exon 2 recognition without affecting Rev-dependent vif expression.Under the conditions of our assay, the rate limiting step of retroviral splicing, competing with Rev function, seems to be exclusively determined by the functional strength of the 3' splice site. The bipartite ASF/SF2-dependent ESE within HIV-1 exon 2 supports cross-talk between splice site pairs across exon 2 (exon definition) which is incompatible with processing of the intron-containing vif mRNA. We propose that Rev mediates a switch from exon to intron definition necessary for the expression of all intron-containing mRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {AIDS and the bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) are severe combined immunodeficiencies. BLS results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression of class II major histocompatibility (MHC II) determinants. One of these is the class II transactivator (CIITA). HIV and its transcriptional transactivator (Tat) also block the expression of MHC II genes. By binding to the same surface in the cyclin T1, which together with CDK9 forms the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, Tat inhibits CIITA. CIITA can also activate transcription when tethered artificially to RNA. Moreover, a dominant-negative CDK9 protein inhibits the activity of MHC II promoters. Thus, CIITA is a novel cellular coactivator that binds to P-TEFb for the expression of its target genes.},

Much of the understanding of HIV-1 disease progression derives from studies in the developed world where HIV infection is almost exclusively subtype B. This has led many to question whether the properties and consequences of HIV-1 infection can be generalized across subtypes that afflict the majority of infected persons in the developing world. From 1985 to 1997, a prospective study of registered female sex workers in Senegal tracked the introduction and spread of HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D, and G. In clinical follow-up, the AIDS-free survival curves differed by HIV-1 subtype. Women infected with a non-A subtype were 8 times more likely to develop AIDS than were those infected with subtype A (hazard ratio=8.23; P=. 009), the predominant subtype in the study. These data suggest that HIV-1 subtypes may differ in rates of progression to AIDS.},

We also report a fascinating correlation between the positions of css and introns, whereby css within the exons of one species frequently match the exact position of introns in equivalent genes from another species. These results strongly indicate that many introns were inserted into css during evolution and they also imply that the splicing information that lies outside some introns can be independently recognized by the splicing machinery and was in place prior to intron insertion. This indicates that non-intronic splicing information had a key role in shaping the split structure of eukaryote genes.},

The medical genetics and molecular biology communities are increasingly turning to computational biology methods to prioritize interesting SNPs found in linkage and association studies. Many such methods are now available through web interfaces, but the interested user is confronted with an array of predictive results that are often in disagreement with each other. Many tools today produce results that are difficult to understand without bioinformatics expertise, are biased towards non-synonymous SNPs, and do not necessarily reflect up-to-date versions of their source bioinformatics resources, such as public SNP repositories. Here, I assess the utility of the current generation of webservers; and suggest improvements for the next generation of webservers to better deliver value to medical geneticists and molecular biologists.},

  Abstract                 = {The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) offers online public access to a growing database of genomic sequence and annotations for a large collection of organisms, primarily vertebrates, with an emphasis on the human and mouse genomes. The Browser's web-based tools provide an integrated environment for visualizing, comparing, analysing and sharing both publicly available and user-generated genomic data sets. As of September 2013, the database contained genomic sequence and a basic set of annotation 'tracks' for ∼90 organisms. Significant new annotations include a 60-species multiple alignment conservation track on the mouse, updated UCSC Genes tracks for human and mouse, and several new sets of variation and ENCODE data. New software tools include a Variant Annotation Integrator that returns predicted functional effects of a set of variants uploaded as a custom track, an extension to UCSC Genes that displays haplotype alleles for protein-coding genes and an expansion of data hubs that includes the capability to display remotely hosted user-provided assembly sequence in addition to annotation data. To improve European access, we have added a Genome Browser mirror (http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu) hosted at Bielefeld University in Germany.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid, on-site human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing has the potential to improve the delivery of prevention services in publicly funded counseling and testing sites. The Single Use Diagnostic System (SUDS) HIV-1 is the only rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) approved for diagnostic use in the United States. To evaluate the feasibility of using SUDS in public clinics and to validate the test's performance in a public health laboratory, we conducted blinded SUDS testing on plasma sent for HIV testing. From 19 March through 30 June 1993, 1,923 consecutive samples from a sexually transmitted diseases clinic and an HIV counseling and testing clinic were tested on site with SUDS. Tests done in the first two weeks with a malfunctioning centrifuge n = 402) and those done when there were excessively high temperatures in the laboratory (n = 53) were analyzed separately. Of 1,466 tests, 39 were positive by both SUDS and EIA (with Western blot [immunoblot] confirmation) and 7 were SUDS positive and EIA negative. Western blotting was used as the "gold standard" to adjudicate these discrepancies. There were no SUDS-negative and EIA-positive tests. Compared with that of EIA (with Western blot confirmation), the sensitivity of SUDS was 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 88.8 to 100\%) and the specificity was 99.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 98.9 to 99.8\%). The positive predictive value of SUDS was 88\% in the STD clinic and 81\% in the HIV counseling and testing clinic. There was a 7.7-fold increase in false positives, from 0.48 to 3.7\%, when there was inadequate centrifugation and when the temperature exceeded the manufacturer's recommendations. Rapid, on-site HIV testing by the SUDS assay is feasible and practical in public health settings. The test can be performed accurately, at reasonable cost, and within the time frame of a typical clinic visit. Caution should be used, however, as two conditions adversely affected the accuracy of this test: inadequate specimen preparation and elevated temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {Through alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms that often differ in function. To infer isoform regulation from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-seq), we developed the mixture-of-isoforms (MISO) model, a statistical model that estimates expression of alternatively spliced exons and isoforms and assesses confidence in these estimates. Incorporation of mRNA fragment length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.},

These include immunodeficiencies (such as HIV/AIDS in humans), malignancies, and lymphatic and neurological disorders in primates, felids, and a variety of wild and domesticated ungulates. Evolutionary analyses of the genomic sequences of modern-day lentiviruses have suggested a relatively recent date for their emergence, but the failure to identify any endogenous, vertically transmitted examples has meant that their longer term evolutionary history and origin remain unknown. Here we report the discovery and characterization of retroviral sequences belonging to a new lentiviral subgroup from the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). These viruses, the first endogenous examples described, are >7 million years old and thus provide the first evidence for an ancient origin of the lentiviruses. Despite being ancient, this subgroup contains many of the features found in present-day lentiviruses, such as the presence of tat and rev genes, thus also indicating an ancient origin for the complex regulation of lentivirus gene expression. Although the virus we describe is defective, reconstruction of an infectious progenitor could provide novel insights into lentivirus biology and host interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) persists in a latent state within resting CD4+ T cells of infected persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This reservoir must be eliminated for the clearance of infection. Using a cDNA library screen, we have identified methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) as a regulator of HIV-1 latency. Two CpG islands flank the HIV-1 transcription start site and are methylated in latently infected Jurkat cells and primary CD4+ T cells. MBD2 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) are found at one of these CpG islands during latency. Inhibition of cytosine methylation with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (aza-CdR) abrogates recruitment of MBD2 and HDAC2. Furthermore, aza-CdR potently synergizes with the NF-kappaB activators prostratin or TNF-alpha to reactivate latent HIV-1. These observations confirm that cytosine methylation and MBD2 are epigenetic regulators of HIV-1 latency. Clearance of HIV-1 from infected persons may be enhanced by inclusion of DNA methylation inhibitors, such as aza-CdR, and NF-kappaB activators into current antiviral therapies.},

  Abstract                 = {Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) play an important and varied role in cellular function. A significant amount of research has been devoted to computational prediction of these genes from genomic sequence, but the ability to do so has remained elusive due to a lack of apparent genomic features. In this work, thermodynamic stability of ncRNA structural elements, as summarized in a Z-score, is used to predict ncRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This analysis was coupled with comparative genomics to search for ncRNA genes on chromosome six of S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. Sets of positive and negative control genes were evaluated to determine the efficacy of thermodynamic stability for discriminating ncRNA from background sequence. The effect of window sizes and step sizes on the sensitivity of ncRNA identification was also explored. Non-coding RNA gene candidates, common to both S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus, were verified using northern blot analysis, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and publicly available cDNA library data. Four ncRNA transcripts are well supported by experimental data (RUF10, RUF11, RUF12, RUF13), while one additional putative ncRNA transcript is well supported but the data are not entirely conclusive. Six candidates appear to be structural elements in 5' or 3' untranslated regions of annotated protein-coding genes. This work shows that thermodynamic stability, coupled with comparative genomics, can be used to predict ncRNA with significant structural elements.},

  Abstract                 = {We have used comparative genomics to characterize the evolutionary behavior of predicted splicing regulatory motifs. Using base substitution rates in intronic regions as a calibrator for neutral change, we found a strong avoidance of synonymous substitutions that disrupt predicted exonic splicing enhancers or create predicted exonic splicing silencers. These results attest to the functionality of the hexameric motif set used and suggest that they are subject to purifying selection. We also found that synonymous substitutions in constitutive exons tend to create exonic splicing enhancers and to disrupt exonic splicing silencers, implying positive selection for these splicing promoting events. We present evidence that this positive selection is the result of splicing-positive events compensating for splicing-negative events as well as for mutations that weaken splice-site sequences. Such compensatory events include nonsynonymous mutations, synonymous mutations, and mutations at splice sites. Compensation was also seen from the fact that orthologous exons tend to maintain the same number of predicted splicing motifs. Our data fit a splicing compensation model of exon evolution, in which selection for splicing-positive mutations takes place to counter the effect of an ongoing splicing-negative mutational process, with the exon as a whole being conserved as a unit of splicing. In the course of this analysis, we observed that synonymous positions in general are conserved relative to intronic sequences, suggesting that messenger RNA molecules are rich in sequence information for functions beyond protein coding and splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {A better understanding of changes in HIV-1 population genetics with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is critical for designing eradication strategies. We therefore analyzed HIV-1 genetic variation and divergence in patients' plasma before cART, during suppression on cART, and after viral rebound. Single-genome sequences of plasma HIV-1 RNA were obtained from HIV-1 infected patients prior to cART (N = 14), during suppression on cART (N = 14) and/or after viral rebound following interruption of cART (N = 5). Intra-patient population diversity was measured by average pairwise difference (APD). Population structure was assessed by phylogenetic analyses and a test for panmixia. Measurements of intra-population diversity revealed no significant loss of overall genetic variation in patients treated for up to 15 years with cART. A test for panmixia, however, showed significant changes in population structure in 2/10 patients after short-term cART (<1 year) and in 7/10 patients after long-term cART (1-15 years). The changes consisted of diverse sets of viral variants prior to cART shifting to populations containing one or more genetically uniform subpopulations during cART. Despite these significant changes in population structure, rebound virus after long-term cART had little divergence from pretherapy virus, implicating long-lived cells infected before cART as the source for rebound virus. The appearance of genetically uniform virus populations and the lack of divergence after prolonged cART and cART interruption provide strong evidence that HIV-1 persists in long-lived cells infected before cART was initiated, that some of these infected cells may be capable of proliferation, and that on-going cycles of viral replication are not evident.},

  Abstract                 = {The precise identification of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) responsible for productive clinical infection could be instrumental in elucidating the molecular basis of HIV-1 transmission and in designing effective vaccines. Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete env sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute HIV-1 (clade B) infection. Viral env genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of CCR5 dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of HIV-1 to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

Yet uncertainty persists regarding its natural reservoir. The virus most closely related to HIV-1 is a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) thus far identified only in captive members of the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes. Here we report the detection of SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids in fecal samples from wild-living P. t. troglodytes apes in southern Cameroon, where prevalence rates in some communities reached 29 to 35\%. By sequence analysis of endemic SIVcpz strains, we could trace the origins of pandemic (group M) and nonpandemic (group N) HIV-1 to distinct, geographically isolated chimpanzee communities. These findings establish P. t. troglodytes as a natural reservoir of HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {Mortality within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study for the years 1990-2001 was compared with the mortality of the general Swiss population.Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and life tables were calculated for strata defined by combinations of gender and HIV transmission group. The effect of dropouts was investigated with a sensitivity analysis and by analysing CD4 cell counts before dropout.During the study period 10 977 individuals had at least one cohort visit with a median observation time of 46 months. A total of 3630 patients died and 2290 dropped out. SMR decreased from 79.3 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 77.2-81.5] before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in 1996 to 15.3 (95\% CI, 14.2-16.4) thereafter. For persons who acquired HIV infection by injecting drug use (IDUs), the SMR decreased from 98.2 (95\% CI, 94.9-103.5) to 40.9 (95\% CI, 37.0-44.8) after 1996; for all other HIV transmission groups the SMR decreased from 69.2 (95\% CI, 66.9-71.6) to 9.4 (95\% CI, 8.5-10.4). Thus, IDUs had significantly lower survival in comparison with other patient groups after 1996. Patients who had started HAART during the time period in which this treatment was available, had even lower SMRs.Although overall survival has improved considerably since the introduction of HAART, cohort life expectancy remains below that of the Swiss population. We noted, however, substantial differences in mortality among subgroups, and the results indicate that the additional risk related to injection drug use before 1996 had been masked by HIV-associated mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Indole derivatives compounds (IDC) are a new class of splicing inhibitors that have a selective action on exonic splicing enhancers (ESE)-dependent activity of individual serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins. Some of these molecules have been shown to compromise assembly of HIV infectious particles in cell cultures by interfering with the activity of the SR protein SF2/ASF and by subsequently suppressing production of splicing-dependent retroviral accessory proteins. For all replication-competent retroviruses, a limiting requirement for infection and pathogenesis is the expression of the envelope glycoprotein which strictly depends on the host splicing machinery. Here, we have evaluated the efficiency of IDC on an animal model of retroviral pathogenesis using a fully replication-competent retrovirus. In this model, all newborn mice infected with a fully replicative murine leukemia virus (MLV) develop erythroleukemia within 6 to 8 weeks of age. We tested several IDC for their ability to interfere ex vivo with MLV splicing and virus spreading as well as for their protective effect in vivo. We show here that two of these IDC, IDC13 and IDC78, selectively altered splicing-dependent production of the retroviral envelope gene, thus inhibiting early viral replication in vivo, sufficiently to protect mice from MLV-induced pathogenesis. The apparent specificity and clinical safety observed here for both IDC13 and IDC78 strongly support further assessment of inhibitors of SR protein splicing factors as a new class of antiretroviral therapeutic agents.},

  Abstract                 = {The structures of RNA molecules are often important for their function and regulation, yet there are no experimental techniques for genome-scale measurement of RNA structure. Here we describe a novel strategy termed parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), which is based on deep sequencing fragments of RNAs that were treated with structure-specific enzymes, thus providing simultaneous in vitro profiling of the secondary structure of thousands of RNA species at single nucleotide resolution. We apply PARS to profile the secondary structure of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and obtain structural profiles for over 3,000 distinct transcripts. Analysis of these profiles reveals several RNA structural properties of yeast transcripts, including the existence of more secondary structure over coding regions compared with untranslated regions, a three-nucleotide periodicity of secondary structure across coding regions and an anti-correlation between the efficiency with which an mRNA is translated and the structure over its translation start site. PARS is readily applicable to other organisms and to profiling RNA structure in diverse conditions, thus enabling studies of the dynamics of secondary structure at a genomic scale.},

In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ nanopore sequencer to accurately identify and differentiate bacterial and viral samples via directed sequencing of characteristic genes shared broadly across a target clade.Using a 6 hour sequencing run time, sufficient data were generated to identify an E. coli sample down to the species level from 16S rDNA amplicons. Three poxviruses (cowpox, vaccinia-MVA, and vaccinia-Lister) were identified and differentiated down to the strain level, despite over 98\% identity between the vaccinia strains. The ability to differentiate strains by amplicon sequencing on the MinION™ was accomplished despite an observed per-base error rate of approximately 30\%.While nanopore sequencing, using the MinION™ platform from Oxford Nanopore in particular, continues to mature into a commercially available technology, practical uses are sought for the current versions of the technology. This study offers evidence of the utility of amplicon sequencing by demonstrating that the current versions of MinION™ technology can accurately identify and differentiate both viral and bacterial species present within biological samples via amplicon sequencing.},

Because it is independent of gene annotation, TopHat-Fusion can discover fusion products deriving from known genes, unknown genes and unannotated splice variants of known genes. Using RNA-seq data from breast and prostate cancer cell lines, we detected both previously reported and novel fusions with solid supporting evidence.

  Abstract                 = {Despite major advances over the last two decades in our understanding of RNA splicing and (post-) transcriptional regulation in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), debate continues on the mechanisms and effects of Rev protein on HIV-1 growth. Moreover, arguments that HIV-1 has been optimised for growth have been largely based on speculation. Here, we begin systematically to address these issues by developing a detailed kinetic model for HIV-1 intracellular development. The model accounts for transcription, successive steps in RNA splicing, nuclear export of mRNAs, translation and shuttling of Rev and Tat, Tat-mediated transactivation of transcription, thresholds on Rev in its effects on nuclear export of mRNA, and inhibitory effects of Rev on splicing. Using the model, we found that inefficient splicing of HIV-1 mRNA was generally beneficial for HIV-1 growth, but that an excessive reduction in the splicing efficiency could be detrimental, suggesting that there exists a splicing efficiency that optimises HIV-1 growth. Further, we identified two key contributors to splicing efficiency, the intrinsic splicing rate and the extent of Rev-mediated splicing inhibition, and we showed how these should be balanced for HIV-1 to optimise its growth. Finally, we found that HIV-1 growth is relatively insensitive to different levels of the Rev export threshold, and we suggest that this mechanism evolved to delay viral growth, perhaps to enable evasion of host defensive responses. In summary, our model provides a quantitative and qualitative framework for probing how constituent mechanisms contribute to the complex, yet logical, process of HIV-1 growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) relies on both partial and complete splicing of its full-length RNA transcripts to generate a distribution of essential spliced mRNA products. The complexity of the splicing process, which can employ multiple alternative splice sites, challenges our ability to understand how mutations in splice sites may influence the composition of the resulting mRNA pool and, more broadly, the development of viral progeny. Here, we begin to systematically address these issues by developing a mechanistic mathematical model for the splicing process. We identify as key parameters the probabilities that the cellular splice machinery selects specific splice acceptors, and we show how the splicing process depends on these probabilities. Further, by incorporating this splicing model into a detailed kinetic model for HIV-1 intracellular development we find that an increase in the fraction of either rev or tat mRNA in the HIV-1 mRNA pool is generally beneficial for HIV-1 growth. However, a splice site mutation that excessively increases the fraction of either mRNA can be detrimental due to the corresponding reduction in the other mRNA, suggesting that a balance of Rev and Tat is needed in order for HIV-1 to optimize its growth. Although our model is based on still very limited quantitative data on RNA splicing, Rev-mediated splicing regulation and nuclear export, and the effects of associated mutations, it serves as a starting point for better understanding how variations in essential post-transcriptional functions can impact the intracellular development of HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {The persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) has long been attributed to its high mutation rate and the capacity of its resulting heterogeneous virus populations to evade host immune responses and antiviral drugs. However, this view is incomplete because it does not explain how the virus persists in light of the adverse effects mutations in the viral genome and variations in host functions can potentially have on viral functions and growth. Here we show that the resilience of HIV-1 can be credited, at least in part, to a robust response to perturbations that emerges as an intrinsic property of its intracellular development. Specifically, robustness in HIV-1 arises through the coupling of two feedback loops: a Rev-mediated negative feedback and a Tat-mediated positive feedback. By employing a mechanistic kinetic model for its growth we found that HIV-1 buffers the effects of many potentially detrimental variations in essential viral and cellular functions, including the binding of Rev to mRNA; the level of rev mRNA in the pool of fully spliced mRNA; the splicing of mRNA; the Rev-mediated nuclear export of incompletely-spliced mRNAs; and the nuclear import of Tat and Rev. The virus did not, however, perform robustly to perturbations in all functions. Notably, HIV-1 tended to amplify rather than buffer adverse effects of variations in the interaction of Tat with viral mRNA. This result shows how targeting therapeutics against molecular components of the viral positive-feedback loop open new possibilities and potential in the effective treatment of HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 Vpr-binding protein (VprBP) has been implicated in the regulation of both DNA replication and cell cycle progression, but its precise role remains unclear. Here we report that VprBP regulates the p53-induced transcription and apoptotic pathway. VprBP is recruited to p53-responsive promoters and suppresses p53 transactivation in the absence of stress stimuli. To maintain target promoters in an inactive state, VprBP stably binds to nucleosomes by recognizing unacetylated H3 tails. Promoter-localized deacetylation of H3 tails is a prerequisite for VprBP to tether and act as a bona fide inhibitor at p53 target genes. VprBP knockdown leads to activation of p53 target genes and causes an increase in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Moreover, phosphorylation of VprBP at serine 895 impairs the ability of VprBP to bind H3 tails and to repress p53 transactivation. Our results thus reveal a new role for VprBP in regulation of the p53 signaling pathway, as well as molecular mechanisms of cancer development related to VprBP misregulation.},

We have established a single-cycle growth condition for HIV in H9 cells, a human CD4+ lymphocyte line. The full-length viral linear DNA is first detectable by 4 h postinfection. During a one-step growth of HIV, amounts of viral DNA gradually increase until 8 to 12 h postinfection and then decrease. The copy number of unintegrated viral DNA is not extraordinarily high even at its peak. Most strikingly, there is a temporal program of RNA accumulation: the earliest RNA is greatly enriched in the 2-kilobase subgenomic mRNA species, while the level of 9.2-kilobase RNA which is both genomic RNA and mRNA remains low until after 24 h of infection. Virus production begins at about 24 h postinfection. Thus, viral DNA synthesis is as rapid as for other retroviruses, but viral RNA synthesis involves temporal alteration in the species that accumulate, presumably as a consequence of viral regulatory genes.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that play a regulatory role in numerous and diverse eukaryotic cellular processes. Virus-encoded miRNAs have garnered much interest, although the functions of most remain to be deciphered. To date, readily detectable, evolutionarily conserved natural miRNAs have only been identified from viruses with DNA genomes. Combined with the fact that most miRNAs are generated from endonucleolytic cleavage of longer transcripts, this finding has led to a common conception that naturally occurring RNA viruses will not encode miRNAs to avoid unproductive cleavage of their genomes or mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a retrovirus with an RNA genome, encodes a conserved cluster of miRNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). Thus, the BLV miRNAs avoid the conundrum of genome/mRNA cleavage because only the subgenomic pol III transcripts are efficiently processed into miRNAs. BLV infection is strongly associated with B-cell tumors in cattle. Because most cells in BLV-associated tumors express little viral mRNAs or proteins, exactly how BLV contributes to tumorigenesis has remained a decades-long unsolved mystery. One BLV miRNA, BLV-miR-B4, shares partial sequence identity and shared common targets with the host miRNA, miR-29. As miR-29 overexpression is associated with B-cell neoplasms that resemble BLV-associated tumors, our findings suggest a possible mechanism contributing to BLV-induced tumorigenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of mutations that are present in a small fraction of DNA templates is essential for progress in several areas of biomedical research. Although massively parallel sequencing instruments are in principle well suited to this task, the error rates in such instruments are generally too high to allow confident identification of rare variants. We here describe an approach that can substantially increase the sensitivity of massively parallel sequencing instruments for this purpose. The keys to this approach, called the Safe-Sequencing System ("Safe-SeqS"), are (i) assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each template molecule, (ii) amplification of each uniquely tagged template molecule to create UID families, and (iii) redundant sequencing of the amplification products. PCR fragments with the same UID are considered mutant ("supermutants") only if ≥95\% of them contain the identical mutation. We illustrate the utility of this approach for determining the fidelity of a polymerase, the accuracy of oligonucleotides synthesized in vitro, and the prevalence of mutations in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of normal cells.},

Subsequent studies established a striking number of Nef functions that evidently contribute to the maintenance of high viral loads associated with the development of immunodeficiency in the 'evolutionary-recent' human and the experimental macaque hosts. Recent data show that many Nef activities are conserved across different lineages of HIV and SIV. However, some differences also exist. For example, Nef alleles from most SIVs that do not cause disease in their natural monkey hosts, but not those of HIV-1 and its simian precursors, down-modulate TCR-CD3 to suppress T cell activation and programmed death. This evolutionary loss of a specific Nef function may contribute to the high virulence of HIV-1 in humans.},

Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

Subtype, viral load, and CD4(+) cell count were determined. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (defined as a CD4(+) cell count of < or =250 cells/mm(3)) and to AIDS-associated death.A total of 59.1\% of study subjects had subtype D strains, 15.1\% had subtype A, 21.1\% had intersubtype recombinant subtypes, 4.3\% had multiple subtypes, and 0.3\% had subtype C. Of the 350 subjects, 129 (37\%) progressed to AIDS, and 68 (19.5\%) died of AIDS. The median time to AIDS onset was shorter for persons with subtype D (6.5 years), recombinant subtypes (5.6 years), or multiple subtypes (5.8 years), compared with persons with subtype A (8.0 years; P = .022). Relative to subtype A, adjusted HRs of progression to AIDS were 2.13 [95\% confidence interval {CI}, 1.10-4.11] for subtype D, 2.16 [95\% CI, 1.05-4.45] for recombinant subtypes, and 4.40 [95\% CI, 1.71-11.3] for multiple subtypes. The risk of progression to death was significantly higher for subtype D (adjusted HR, 5.65; 95\% CI, 1.37-23.4), recombinant subtypes (adjusted HR, 6.70; 95\% CI, 1.56-28.8), and multiple subtypes (adjusted HR, 7.67; 95\% CI, 1.27-46.3), compared with subtype A.HIV disease progression is affected by HIV-1 subtype. This finding may impact decisions on when to initiate antiretroviral therapy and may have implications for future trials of HIV-1 vaccines aimed at slowing disease progression.},

Some have suggested that processing by the Drosha and Dicer enzymes might preclude the viability of a replicating retroviral RNA genome that contains a cis-embedded miRNA. To date, while many studies have shown that lentiviral vectors containing miRNAs can transduce mammalian cells and express the inserted miRNA efficiently, no study has examined the impact on the replication of a lentivirus such as HIV-1 after the deliberate intragenomic insertion of a bona fide miRNA.We have constructed several HIV-1 molecular clones, each containing a discrete cellular miRNA positioned in Nef. These retroviral genomes express the inserted miRNA and are generally replication competent in T-cells. The inserted intragenomic miRNA was observed to elicit two different consequences for HIV-1 replication. First, the expression of miRNAs with predicted target sequences in the HIV-1 genome was found to reduce viral replication. Second, in one case, where an inserted miRNA was unusually well-processed by Drosha, this processing event inhibited viral replication.This is the first study to examine in detail the replication competence of HIV-1 genomes that express cis-embedded miRNAs. The results indicate that a replication competent retroviral genome is not precluded from encoding and expressing a viral miRNA.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a regulatory mechanism conserved in higher eukaryotes. The RNAi pathway generates small interfering RNA (siRNA) or micro RNA (miRNA) from either long double stranded stretches of RNA or RNA hairpins, respectively. The siRNA or miRNA then guides an effector complex to a homologous sequence of mRNA and regulates suppression of gene expression through one of several mechanisms. The suppression of gene expression through these mechanisms serves to regulate endogenous gene expression and protect the cell from foreign nucleic acids. There is growing evidence that many viruses have developed in the context of RNAi and express either a suppressor of RNAi or their own viral miRNA.In this study we investigated the possibility that the HIV-1 TAR element, a hairpin structure of ~50 nucleotides found at the 5' end of the HIV viral mRNA, is recognized by the RNAi machinery and processed to yield a viral miRNA. We show that the protein Dicer, the enzyme responsible for cleaving miRNA and siRNA from longer RNA sequences, is expressed in CD4+ T-cells. Interestingly, the level of expression of Dicer in monocytes is sub-optimal, suggesting a possible role for RNAi in maintaining latency in T-cells. Using a biotin labeled TAR element we demonstrate that Dicer binds to this structure. We show that recombinant Dicer is capable of cleaving the TAR element in vitro and that TAR derived miRNA is present in HIV-1 infected cell lines and primary T-cell blasts. Finally, we show that a TAR derived miRNA is capable of regulating viral gene expression and may be involved in repressing gene expression through transcriptional silencing.HIV-1 TAR element is processed by the Dicer enzyme to create a viral miRNA. This viral miRNA is detectable in infected cells and appears to contribute to viral latency.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA interference is a gene regulatory mechanism that employs small RNA molecules such as microRNA. Previous work has shown that HIV-1 produces TAR viral microRNA. Here we describe the effects of the HIV-1 TAR derived microRNA on cellular gene expression.Using a variation of standard techniques we have cloned and sequenced both the 5' and 3' arms of the TAR miRNA. We show that expression of the TAR microRNA protects infected cells from apoptosis and acts by down-regulating cellular genes involved in apoptosis. Specifically, the microRNA down-regulates ERCC1 and IER3, protecting the cell from apoptosis. Comparison to our cloned sequence reveals possible target sites for the TAR miRNA as well.The TAR microRNA is expressed in all stages of the viral life cycle, can be detected in latently infected cells, and represents a mechanism wherein the virus extends the life of the infected cell for the purpose of increasing viral replication.},

  Abstract                 = {Many viruses, including retroviruses, are characterized by their specific cell tropism. Lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) is a human lymphotropic retrovirus isolated from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related syndromes, that displays selective tropism for a subset of T lymphocytes defined by the expression of a surface glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 62,000 (62K) termed T4 (refs 6-8). This glycoprotein delineates a subset of T lymphocytes with mainly helper/inducer functions, while T lymphocytes of the reciprocal subset express a glycoprotein termed T8, have mainly cytotoxic/suppressor activities, and are unable to replicate LAV. Such a tropism may be controlled at the genomic level by regulatory sequences, as described for the human T-cell leukaemia viruses HTLV-I and -II (refs 2, 3). Alternatively or concomitantly, productive cell infection may be controlled at the membrane level, requiring the interaction of a specific cellular receptor with the virus envelope, as demonstrated recently for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Therefore, we have investigated whether the T4 molecule itself is related to the receptor for LAV. We report here that preincubation of T4+ lymphocytes with three individual monoclonal antibodies directed at the T4 glycoprotein blocked cell infection by LAV. This blocking effect was specific, as other monoclonal antibodies--such as antibody to histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) class II or anti-T-cell natural killer (TNK) target--directed at other surface structures strongly expressed on activated cultured T4+ cells, did not prevent LAV infection. Direct virus neutralization by monoclonal antibodies was also ruled out. These results strongly support the view that a surface molecule directly involved in cellular functions acts as, or is related to, the receptor for a human retrovirus.},

To investigate in detail alterations in the transcriptome of the CD4+ T cells upon viral infection, we sequenced polyadenylated RNA isolated from Jurkat cells infected or not with HIV-1. We found a marked global alteration of gene expression following infection, with an overall trend toward induction of genes, indicating widespread modification of the host biology. Annotation and pathway analysis of the most deregulated genes showed that viral infection produces a down-regulation of genes associated with the nucleolus, in particular those implicated in regulating the different steps of ribosome biogenesis, such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription, pre-rRNA processing, and ribosome maturation. The impact of HIV-1 infection on genes involved in ribosome biogenesis was further validated in primary CD4+ T cells. Moreover, we provided evidence by Northern Blot experiments, that host pre-rRNA processing in Jurkat cells might be perturbed during HIV-1 infection, thus strengthening the hypothesis of a crosstalk between nucleolar functions and viral pathogenesis.},

We investigated the nature of the mRNAs expressed in the early stages of infection when the 2 kilobase subgenomic species predominate. RNA was analyzed in the early phase of a one-step growth cycle of HIV-1 infection in T-lymphoid and monocytic cell lines by using PCR amplification of in vitro-synthesized viral cDNAs. In both cell lines, expression of Tat-, Rev-, and Nef-specific messages appeared simultaneously and could be detected within 8-12 hr of infection but in different amounts with a predominance of Nef-specific message. The Env-specific message could be detected as early as the Rev-specific message, indicating that expression of at least small amounts of the singly spliced message could occur before the accumulation of Rev.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent evidence proposes a novel concept that mammalian natural antisense RNAs play important roles in cellular homeostasis by regulating the expression of several genes. Identification and characterization of retroviral antisense RNA would provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis. HIV-1 encoded-antisense RNAs have been reported, although their structures and functions remain to be studied. We have tried to identify and characterize antisense RNAs of HIV-1 and their function in viral infection.Characterization of transcripts of HEK293T cells that were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid with HIV-1NL4-3 DNA in the antisense orientation showed that various antisense transcripts can be expressed. By screening and characterizing antisense RNAs in HIV-1NL4-3-infected cells, we defined the primary structure of a major form of HIV-1 antisense RNAs, which corresponds to a variant of previously reported ASP mRNA. This 2.6 kb RNA was transcribed from the U3 region of the 3' LTR and terminated at the env region in acutely or chronically infected cell lines and acutely infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Reporter assays clearly demonstrated that the HIV-1 LTR harbours promoter activity in the reverse orientation. Mutation analyses suggested the involvement of NF-κΒ binding sites in the regulation of antisense transcription. The antisense RNA was localized in the nuclei of the infected cells. The expression of this antisense RNA suppressed HIV-1 replication for more than one month. Furthermore, the specific knockdown of this antisense RNA enhanced HIV-1 gene expression and replication.The results of the present study identified an accurate structure of the major form of antisense RNAs expressed from the HIV-1NL4-3 provirus and demonstrated its nuclear localization. Functional studies collectively demonstrated a new role of the antisense RNA in viral replication. Thus, we suggest a novel viral mechanism that self-limits HIV-1 replication and provides new insight into the viral life cycle.},

The unprece-dented throughput and relatively short read lengths of Roche/454, Illumina/Solexa, and other platforms have spurred development of a new generation of sequence alignment algorithms. Yet detection of sequence variants based on short read alignments remains chal-lenging, and most currently available tools are limited to a single platform or aligner type. We present VarScan, an open source tool for variant detection that is compatible with several short read align-ers. We demonstrate VarScan's ability to detect SNPs and indels with high sensitivity and specificity, in both Roche/454 sequencing of individuals and deep Illumina/Solexa sequencing of pooled samples.

By using the techniques of cocultivation for virus isolation, in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy, the identity of an important cell type that supports replication of the AIDS retrovirus in brain tissue was determined in two affected individuals. These cells were mononucleated and multinucleated macrophages that actively synthesized viral RNA and produced progeny virions in the brains of the patients.

  Abstract                 = {Retroviral proteins are synthesized as polyprotein precursors that undergo proteolytic cleavages to yield the mature viral proteins. The role of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease in the viral replication cycle was examined by use of a site-directed mutation in the protease gene. The HIV protease gene product was expressed in Escherichia coli and observed to cleave HIV gag p55 to gag p24 and gag p17 in vitro. Substitution of aspartic acid residue 25 (Asp-25) of this protein with an asparagine residue did not affect the expression of the protein, but it eliminated detectable in vitro proteolytic activity against HIV gag p55. A mutant HIV provirus was constructed that contained the Asn-25 mutation within the protease gene. SW480 human colon carcinoma cells transfected with the Asn-25 mutant proviral DNA produced virions that contained gag p55 but not gag p24, whereas virions from cells transfected with the wild-type DNA contained both gag p55 and gag p24. The mutant virions were not able to infect MT-4 lymphoid cells. In contrast, these cells were highly sensitive to infection by the wild-type virions. These results demonstrate that the HIV protease is an essential viral enzyme and, consequently, an attractive target for anti-HIV drugs.},

The polymerase (pol) domain of the 66-kilodalton subunit has a large cleft analogous to that of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. However, the 51-kilodalton subunit of identical sequence has no such cleft because the four subdomains of the pol domain occupy completely different relative positions. Two of the four pol subdomains appear to be structurally related to subdomains of the Klenow fragment, including one containing the catalytic site. The subdomain that appears likely to bind the template strand at the pol active site has a different structure in the two polymerases. Duplex A-form RNA-DNA hybrid can be model-built into the cleft that runs between the ribonuclease H and pol active sites. Nevirapine is almost completely buried in a pocket near but not overlapping with the pol active site. Residues whose mutation results in drug resistance have been approximately located.},

  Abstract                 = {Genes with new functions often evolve by gene duplication. Alternative splicing is another means of evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes, which allows a single gene to encode functionally diverse proteins. We investigate a connection between these two evolutionary phenomena. For approximately 10\% of the described cases of substitution alternative splicing, such that either one or another amino acid sequence is included into the protein, evidence of origin by tandem exon duplication was found. This is a conservative estimate because alternative exons are typically short and, on many occasions, duplicates may have diverged beyond recognition. Dating exon duplications through a combination of the available experimental data on alternative splicing in orthologous genes from different species and computational analysis indicates that most of the duplications antedate at least the radiation of mammalian orders or even the radiation of vertebrate classes. At present, tandem exon duplication is the only mechanism of evolution of substitution alternative splicing that can be specifically demonstrated. Along with gene duplication, this could be a major route for generating functional diversity during evolution of multicellular eukaryotes.},

To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves >99.9\% base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally the gene expression pathway has been regarded as being comprised of independent steps, from RNA transcription to protein translation. To date there is increasing evidence of coupling between the different processes of the pathway, specifically between transcription and splicing. To study the interplay between these processes we derived a transcription-splicing integrated network. The nodes of the network included experimentally verified human proteins belonging to three groups of regulators: transcription factors, splicing factors and kinases. The nodes were wired by instances of predicted transcriptional and alternative splicing regulation. Analysis of the network indicated a pervasive cross-regulation among the nodes; specifically, splicing factors are significantly more connected by alternative splicing regulatory edges relative to the two other subgroups, while transcription factors are more extensively controlled by transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we found that splicing factors are the most regulated of the three regulatory groups and are subject to extensive combinatorial control by alternative splicing and transcriptional regulation. Consistent with the network results, our bioinformatics analyses showed that the subgroup of kinases have the highest density of predicted phosphorylation sites. Overall, our systematic study reveals that an organizing principle in the logic of integrated networks favor the regulation of regulatory proteins by the specific regulation they conduct. Based on these results, we propose a new regulatory paradigm postulating that gene expression regulation of the master regulators in the cell is predominantly achieved by cross-regulation.},

Their presence on histones can dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which DNA is packaged and can orchestrate the ordered recruitment of enzyme complexes to manipulate DNA. In this way, histone modifications have the potential to influence many fundamental biological processes, some of which may be epigenetically inherited.},

  Abstract                 = {SF2, an activity necessary for 5' splice site cleavage and lariat formation during pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, has been purified to near homogeneity from HeLa cells. The purest fraction contains only two related polypeptides of 33 kD. This fraction is sufficient to complement an S100 fraction, which contains the remaining splicing factors, to splice several pre-mRNAs. The optimal amount of SF2 required for efficient splicing depends on the pre-mRNA substrate. SF2 is distinct from the hnRNP A1 and U1 snRNP a polypeptides, which are similar in size. Endogenous hnRNA copurifies with SF2, but this activity does not appear to have an essential RNA component. SF2 appear to be necessary for the assembly or stabilization of the earliest specific prespliceosome complex, although in the absence of other components, it can bind RNA in a nonspecific manner. SF2 copurifies with an activity that promotes the annealing of complementary RNAs. Thus, SF2 may promote specific RNA-RNA interactions between snRNAs and pre-mRNA, between complementary snRNA regions, and/or involving intramolecular pre-mRNA helices. Other purified proteins with RNA annealing activity cannot substitute for SF2 in the splicing reaction.},

  Abstract                 = {Three RNA features have been identified that elevate retroviral transgene expression: an intron in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), the absence of aberrant translational start codons and the presence of the post-transcriptional regulatory element (PRE) of the woodchuck hepatitis virus in the 3'UTR. To include such elements into self-inactivating (SIN) vectors with potentially improved safety, we excised the strong retroviral promoter from the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) and inserted it either downstream or upstream of the retroviral RNA packaging signal (Psi). The latter concept is new and allows the use of an intron in the 5'UTR, taking advantage of retroviral splice sites surrounding Psi. Three LTR and four SIN vectors were compared to address the impact of RNA elements on titer, splice regulation and transgene expression. Although titers of SIN vectors were about 20-fold lower than those of their LTR counterparts, inclusion of the PRE allowed production of more than 10(6) infectious units per ml without further vector optimizations. In comparison with state-of-the-art LTR vectors, the intron-containing SIN vectors showed greatly improved splicing. With regard to transgene expression, the intron-containing SIN vectors largely matched or even exceeded the LTR counterparts in all cell types investigated (embryonic carcinoma cells, fibroblasts, primary T cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells).},

  Abstract                 = {A total of 101 different examples of point mutations, which lie in the vicinity of mRNA splice junctions, and which have been held to be responsible for a human genetic disease by altering the accuracy of efficiency of mRNA splicing, have been collated. These data comprise 62 mutations at 5' splice sites, 26 at 3' splice sites and 13 that result in the creation of novel splice sites. It is estimated that up to 15\% of all point mutations causing human genetic disease result in an mRNA splicing defect. Of the 5' splice site mutations, 60\% involved the invariant GT dinucleotide; mutations were found to be non-randomly distributed with an excess over expectation at positions +1 and +2, and apparent deficiencies at positions -1 and -2. Of the 3' splice site mutations, 87\% involved the invariant AG dinucleotide; an excess of mutations over expectation was noted at position -2. This non-randomness of mutation reflects the evolutionary conservation apparent in splice site consensus sequences drawn up previously from primate genes, and is most probably attributable to detection bias resulting from the differing phenotypic severity of specific lesions. The spectrum of point mutations was also drastically skewed: purines were significantly over-represented as substituting nucleotides, perhaps because of steric hindrance (e.g. in U1 snRNA binding at 5' splice sites). Furthermore, splice sites affected by point mutations resulting in human genetic disease were markedly different from the splice site consensus sequences. When similarity was quantified by a 'consensus value', both extremely low and extremely high values were notably absent from the wild-type sequences of the mutated splice sites. Splice sites of intermediate similarity to the consensus sequence may thus be more prone to the deleterious effects of mutation. Regarding the phenotypic effects of mutations on mRNA splicing, exon skipping occurred more frequently than cryptic splice site usage. Evidence is presented that indicates that, at least for 5' splice site mutations, cryptic splice site usage is favoured under conditions where (1) a number of such sites are present in the immediate vicinity and (2) these sites exhibit sufficient homology to the splice site consensus sequence for them to be able to compete successfully with the mutated splice site. The novel concept of a "potential for cryptic splice site usage" value was introduced in order to quantify these characteristics, and to predict the relative proportion of exon skipping vs cryptic splice site utilization consequent to the introduction of a mutation at a normal splice site.},

  Abstract                 = {Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a negative-strand RNA virus with oncolytic activity against human tumors. Its effectiveness against tumors and safety in normal tissue have been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Here we show that the spread of NDV infection is drastically different in normal cell lines than in tumor cell lines and that the two cell types respond differently to beta interferon (IFN-beta) treatment. NDV rapidly replicated and killed HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells but spread poorly in CCD-1122Sk human skin fibroblast cells. Pretreatment with endogenous or exogenous IFN-beta completely inhibited NDV replication in normal cells but had little or no effect in tumor cells. Thus, the outcome of NDV infection appeared to depend on the response of uninfected cells to IFN-beta. To investigate their differences in IFN responsiveness, we analyzed and compared the expression and activation of components of the IFN signal transduction pathway in these two types of cells. The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 and that of the ISGF3 complex were markedly reduced in IFN-beta-treated tumor cells. Moreover, cDNA microarray analysis revealed significantly fewer IFN-regulated genes in the HT-1080 cells than in the CDD-1122Sk cells. This finding suggests that tumor cells demonstrate a less-than-optimum antiviral response because of a lesion in their IFN signal transduction pathway. The rapid spread of NDV in HT-1080 cells appears to be caused by their deficient expression of anti-NDV proteins upon exposure to IFN-beta.},

If domain regions are disrupted, the functional effect, as predicted from 3D structure, is frequently equivalent to removal of the entire domain. Also, short alternative splicing events within domains, which might preserve folded structure, target functional residues more frequently than expected. Thus, it seems that positive selection has had a major role in the evolution of alternative splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses an elaborate alternative splicing pattern for the generation of both the 1.8-kb as well as the 4-kb classes of mRNA. An additional diversity of transcripts in both classes is created by the optional inclusion of the small exons 2 and 3 in the leader sequence. To analyze a possible influence of these leader exons on HIV-1 gene expression, several series of expression vectors with different leaders were constructed, expressing either Rev and Env or a heterologous coding sequence, i.e., the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) ORF. Transfection experiments of HeLa-T4(+) cells revealed for all series of constructs that mRNA as well as protein expression was stimulated by the presence of exon 2 and reduced by exon 3. The function of the leader exons 2 and 3 is neither dependent on the regulatory proteins Tat or Rev nor on viral coding sequences. Neither transcription rates nor stability of polyadenylated RNAs were found to be responsible for the different levels of steady-state mRNA. When either exon 2 or 3 was inserted into a heterologous intron, processing of the primary transcripts generated identical mRNA species while maintaining the differences in exon 2/3-dependent mRNA steady-state levels. These results may be explained by exon-specific nuclear RNA degradation rates, as also indicated by results from an in vitro degradation assay using a HeLa nuclear extract.},

  Abstract                 = {The surface proteins of human influenza A viruses experience positive selection to escape both human immunity and, more recently, antiviral drug treatments. In bacteria and viruses, immune-escape and drug-resistant phenotypes often appear through a combination of several mutations that have epistatic effects on pathogen fitness. However, the extent and structure of epistasis in influenza viral proteins have not been systematically investigated. Here, we develop a novel statistical method to detect positive epistasis between pairs of sites in a protein, based on the observed temporal patterns of sequence evolution. The method rests on the simple idea that a substitution at one site should rapidly follow a substitution at another site if the sites are positively epistatic. We apply this method to the surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza A virus subtypes H3N2 and H1N1. Compared to a non-epistatic null distribution, we detect substantial amounts of epistasis and determine the identities of putatively epistatic pairs of sites. In particular, using sequence data alone, our method identifies epistatic interactions between specific sites in neuraminidase that have recently been demonstrated, in vitro, to confer resistance to the drug oseltamivir; these epistatic interactions are responsible for widespread drug resistance among H1N1 viruses circulating today. This experimental validation demonstrates the predictive power of our method to identify epistatic sites of importance for viral adaptation and public health. We conclude that epistasis plays a large role in shaping the molecular evolution of influenza viruses. In particular, sites with , which would normally not be identified as positively selected, can facilitate viral adaptation through epistatic interactions with their partner sites. The knowledge of specific interactions among sites in influenza proteins may help us to predict the course of antigenic evolution and, consequently, to select more appropriate vaccines and drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the challenges of genetic data analysis is to combine information from sources that are distributed around the world and accessible through a wide array of different methods and interfaces. The HIV database and its footsteps, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hemorrhagic fever virus (HFV) databases, have made it their mission to make different data types easily available to their users. This involves a large amount of behind-the-scenes processing, including quality control and analysis of the sequences and their annotation. Gene and protein sequences are distilled from the sequences that are stored in GenBank; to this end, both submitter annotation and script-generated sequences are used. Alignments of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences are generated, manually curated, distilled into an alignment model, and regenerated in an iterative cycle that results in ever better new alignments. Annotation of epidemiological and clinical information is parsed, checked, and added to the database. User interfaces are updated, and new interfaces are added based upon user requests. Vital for its success, the database staff are heavy users of the system, which enables them to fix bugs and find opportunities for improvement. In this chapter we describe some of the infrastructure that keeps these heavily used analysis platforms alive and vital after nearly 25 years of use.

  Abstract                 = {To identify genes mediating the antiproliferative action of interferon (IFN), two cDNA libraries were constructed with mRNA from IFN-treated and untreated human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells previously shown to be highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of IFN. Differential screening of these two libraries identified cloned sequences whose expression was either induced or repressed with IFN treatment. Rescreening of these sequences with cDNA probes constructed from proliferating or quiescent cells led to the identification of one IFN-induced and three IFN-repressed sequences whose expressions also appeared to be modulated by cell proliferation. Blot-hybridization analysis revealed that RNA levels corresponding to the three repressed genes decreased when HT1080 cells were treated with IFN or when proliferation of normal CUA foreskin fibroblast cells became naturally arrested by contact inhibition. Levels of RNA corresponding to the induced gene increased in HT1080 cells within 24 hr after IFN-treatment but declined below basal levels by 48 hr. Expression of these genes was unaffected or only slightly affected by IFN treatment in variant cells resistant to the antiproliferative effects of IFN. Collectively, these results suggest that the identified cDNAs correspond to genes that are involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN. Moreover, these results also suggest that IFN's antiproliferative action may be exerted through genes that contribute to arresting cell proliferation during contact inhibition.},

  Abstract                 = {Prostratin is a unique phorbol ester that stimulates protein kinase C activity but is nontumor promoting. Remarkably, prostratin is also able to inhibit de novo human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection yet up-regulate viral expression from latent proviruses. Prostratin's lack of tumor promotion, coupled with its ability to block viral spread yet induce latent proviral expression, prompted studies to determine whether this compound could serve as an inductive adjuvant therapy for patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The current experiments indicate that prostratin is a potent mitogen for mononuclear phagocytes possessing many of the activities of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) with notable functional differences. Prostratin, like PMA, accelerates differentiation of the myeloid cell-lines, HL-60 and THP-1, as well as mononuclear phagocytes from bone marrow and peripheral blood. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gene array analyses indicate significant changes in the expression of proteins and messenger RNA after treatment of cells with prostratin, consistent with phagocyte activation and differentiation. Prostratin blocks HIV-1 infection relating to down-regulation of CD4 receptor expression. The array analysis indicates a similar down-regulation of the HIV-1 coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, and this may also reduce viral infectivity of treated host cells. Finally, prostratin is capable of up-regulating HIV-1 expression from CD8+ T lymphocyte-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients undergoing HAART. This novel observation suggests the agent may be an excellent candidate to augment HAART by inducing expression of latent HIV-1 with the ultimate goal of eliminating persistent viral reservoirs in certain individuals infected with HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {The properties and subunit composition of the RNA extracted from RD-114 virions have been studied. The RNA extracted from the virion has a sedimentation coefficient of 52S in a nondenaturing aqueous electrolyte. The estimated molecular weight by sedimentation in nondenaturing and weakly denaturing media is in the range 5.7 X 10(6) to 7.0 X 10(6). By electron microscopy, under moderately denaturing conditions, the 52S molecule is seen to be an extended single strand with a contour length of about 4.0 mum corresponding to a molecular weight of 5.74 X 10(6). It contains two characteristic secondary structure features: (i) a central Y- or T-shaped structure (the rabbit ears) with a molecular weight of 0.3 X 10(6), (ii) two symmetreically disposed loops on each side of and at equal distance from the center. The 52S molecule consists of two half-size molecules, with molecular weight 2.8 X 10(6), joined together within the central rabbit ears feature. Melting of the rabbit ears with concomitant dissociation of the 52S molecule into subunits, has been caused by either one of two strongly denaturing treatments: incubation in a mixture of CH3HgOH and glyoxal at room temperature, or thermal dissociation in a urea-formamide solvent. When half-size molecules are quenched from denaturing temperatures, a new off-center secondary structure feature termed the branch-like structure is seen. The dissociation behavior of the 52S complex and the molecular weight of the subunits have been confirmed by gel electrophoresis studies. The loop structures melt at fairly low temperatures; the dissociation of the 52S molecule into its two subunits occurs at a higher temperature corresponding to a base composition of about 63\% guanosine plus cytosine. Polyadenylic acid mapping by electron microscopy shows that the 52S molecule contains two polyadenylic acid segments, one at each end. It thus appears that 52S RD-114 RNA consists of two 2.8 X 10(6) dalton subunits, each with a characteristic secondary structure loop, and joined at the 5' ends to form the rabbit ears secondary structure feature. The observations are consistent with but do not require the conclusion that the two 2.8 X 10(6) dalton subunits of 52S RD-114 RNA are identical.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular weights, subunit compositions, and secondary structure patterns of the RNAs from an endogenous baboon virus and from a woolly monkey sarcoma virus were examined and compared to the properties of the RNA of RD-114, an endogenous feline virus. The high molecular weight RNA extracted from each of these three viruses has a sedimentation coefficient of 52S, and a molecular length, measured by electron microscopy, of 16-20 kb (kb=kilobase, 1000 nucleotides). Each such RNA is a dimer, containing two monomer subunits of 8-10 kb in length (molecular weight 3 X 10(6) daltons). The two monomer subunits are joined at their non-poly(A) ends in a structure called the dimer linkage structure. The appearance of this structure is somewhat different for the different viruses. The dimer linkage dissociates at temperature estimated to be 87 degrees C in aqueous 0.1M Na+ for RD-114 and baboon viral RNAs, but at the lower temperature of 66 degrees C for woolly monkey RNA. All three viral RNAs have two large loops of similar size and position symmetrically placed on either side of the dimer linkage structure. Since the baboon virus is partially related to RD-114, and the woolly monkey virus is unrelated to either of the other two, the dimer linkage and symmetrical loops are surprisingly similar and may well be common features of type C virus RNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {Vpr, one of the accessory gene products of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), affects aspects of both viral and cellular proliferation, being involved in long terminal repeat (LTR) activation, arrest of the cell cycle at the G2 phase, and apoptosis. We have discovered a novel role for Vpr as a regulator of the splicing of pre-mRNA both in vivo and in vitro. We found, by RT-PCR and RNase protection analysis, that Vpr caused the accumulation of incompletely spliced forms of alpha-globin 2 and beta-globin pre-mRNAs in cells that had been transiently transfected with a Vpr expression vector. We postulated that this novel effect of Vpr might occur via a pathway that is distinct from arrest of the cell cycle at G2. By analyzing splicing reactions in vitro, we showed that Vpr inhibited the splicing of beta-globin pre-mRNA in vitro. The splicing of intron 1 of alpha-globin 2 pre-mRNA was modestly inhibited by Vpr but the splicing of intron 2 was unaffected. Interestingly, an experimental infection system which utilizes high-titered HIV-1/vesticular stomatitis virus G protein showed that Vpr expressed from an HIV-1 provirus was sufficient to accumulate endogenous alpha-globin 2 pre-mRNA. Thus, it is likely that Vpr contributes to selective inhibition of the splicing of cellular pre-mRNA.},

  Abstract                 = {Most retained introns found in human cDNAs generated by high-throughput sequencing projects seem to result from underspliced transcripts, and thus they capture intermediate steps of pre-mRNA splicing. On the other hand, mutations in splice sites cause exon skipping of the respective exon or activation of pre-existing cryptic sites. Both types of events reflect properties of the splicing mechanism.The retained introns were significantly shorter than constitutive ones, and skipped exons are shorter than exons with cryptic sites. Both donor and acceptor splice sites of retained introns were weaker than splice sites of constitutive introns. The authentic acceptor sites affected by mutations were significantly weaker in exons with activated cryptic sites than in skipped exons. The distance from a mutated splice site to the nearest equivalent site is significantly shorter in cases of activated cryptic sites compared to exon skipping events. The prevalence of retained introns within genes monotonically increased in the 5'-to-3' direction (more retained introns close to the 3'-end), consistent with the model of co-transcriptional splicing. The density of exonic splicing enhancers was higher, and the density of exonic splicing silencers lower in retained introns compared to constitutive ones and in exons with cryptic sites compared to skipped exons.Thus the analysis of retained introns in human cDNA, exons skipped due to mutations in splice sites and exons with cryptic sites produced results consistent with the intron definition mechanism of splicing of short introns, co-transcriptional splicing, dependence of splicing efficiency on the splice site strength and the density of candidate exonic splicing enhancers and silencers. These results are consistent with other, recently published analyses.},

Rapid identification of the virus is required to prevent spread of the infection. In this study, we developed and evaluated a one-step simple reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), the most virulent species of EBOV, targeting the trailer region of the viral genome. The assay could detect 20 copies of the artificial ZEBOV RNA in 26 min with a real time-monitoring detection, and also detect 10(-3) FFU of the cell-culture propagated viruses. The reaction time needed to detect 10(4) FFU of ZEBOV was only 20 min. In addition, the assay was highly specific for ZEBOV. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study is rapid, simple, highly specific, and sensitive for the detection of ZEBOV, and so may be an effective diagnostic tool. Furthermore, as this technique does not require sophisticated instrumentation, it seems very suitable for diagnosis in the field or laboratories in Ebola outbreak areas such as Central Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing increases proteomic diversity and provides a potential mechanism underlying both phenotypic diversity and susceptibility to genetic disorders in human populations. To investigate the variation in splicing among humans on a genome-wide scale, we use a comprehensive exon-targeted microarray to examine alternative splicing in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from the CEPH HapMap population. We show the identification of transcripts containing sequence verified exon skipping, intron retention, and cryptic splice site usage that are specific between individuals. A number of novel alternative splicing events with no previous annotations in either the RefSeq and EST databases were identified, indicating that we are able to discover de novo splicing events. Using family-based linkage analysis, we demonstrate Mendelian inheritance and segregation of specific splice isoforms with regulatory haplotypes for three genes: OAS1, CAST, and CRTAP. Allelic association was further used to identify individual SNPs or regulatory haplotype blocks linked to the alternative splicing event, taking advantage of the high-resolution genotype information from the CEPH HapMap population. In one candidate, we identified a regulatory polymorphism that disrupts a 5' splice site of an exon in the CAST gene, resulting in its exclusion in the mutant allele. This report illustrates that our approach can detect both annotated and novel alternatively spliced variants, and that such variation among individuals is heritable and genetically controlled.},

The structure reveals a cavity-laden CD4-gp120 interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a conformational change upon CD4 binding, the nature of a CD4-induced antibody epitope, and specific mechanisms for immune evasion.

  Abstract                 = {An outstanding question of genome evolution is what stops the invasion of a host genome by transposable elements (TEs). The human genome, harboring the remnants of many extinct TE families, offers an extraordinary opportunity to investigate this problem. ERV9 is an endogenous retrovirus repeatedly mobilized during primate evolution, 15 to 6 million years ago (MYA), which left a trace of over a hundred provirus-like copies and at least 4,000 solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) in the human genome. Then, its proliferation ceased for unknown reasons, and the family went extinct. We have made a detailed reconstruction of its last active subfamily, ERV9_XII, by examining 115 solitary LTRs from it. These insertions were grouped into 11 sets according to shared nucleotide variants, which could be placed in a sequential order of 10 to 6 MYA. At least 75\% of the subfamily was produced 8 to 6 MYA, during a stage of intense proliferation. With new analytical tools, we show that the youngest and most prolific sets may have been produced by effectively instantaneous expansions of corresponding single-sequence variants. The extinction of this family apparently was not a consequence of its slow gradual degeneration, but the outcome of the fixation of specific restrictive alleles in the human-chimpanzee ancestral population. Three species-specific insertions (two in humans and one in chimpanzees) were identified, further supporting that extinction took place when these two species were beginning to diverge. These are the only fixed differences of this kind so far observed between humans and chimpanzees, apart from those belonging to the human endogenous retrovirus K family.},

However, point mutations can have a more dramatic effect by altering the splicing pattern of the gene. Here, we describe an approach to estimate the overall importance of splicing mutations. This approach takes into account the complete set of genes known to be involved in disease and suggest that, contrary to current assumptions, many mutations causing disease may actually be affecting the splicing pattern of the genes.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulator Tat is essential for viral replication because it achieves complete elongation of viral transcripts. Tat can be released to the extracellular space and taken up by adjacent cells, exerting profound cytoskeleton rearrangements that lead to apoptosis. In contrast, intracellular Tat has been described as protector from apoptosis. Tat gene is composed by two coding exons that yield a protein of 101 amino acids (aa). First exon (1-72aa) is sufficient for viral transcript elongation and second exon (73-101 aa) appears to contribute to non-transcriptional functions. We observed that Jurkat cells stably expressing intracellular Tat101 showed gene expression deregulation 4-fold higher than cells expressing Tat72. Functional experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of this deregulation. First, NF-kappaB-, NF-AT- and Sp1-dependent transcriptional activities were greatly enhanced in Jurkat-Tat101, whereas Tat72 induced milder but efficient activation. Second, cytoskeleton-related functions as cell morphology, proliferation, chemotaxis, polarization and actin polymerization were deeply altered in Jurkat-Tat101, but not in Jurkat-Tat72. Finally, expression of several cell surface receptors was dramatically impaired by intracellular Tat101 but not by Tat72. Consequently, these modifications were greatly dependent on Tat second exon and they could be related to the anergy observed in HIV-1-infected T cells.},

The evolution of HCV quasispecies in this setting of coinfection is not fully understood. To compare HCV quasispecies between HIV–HCV coinfection and HCV monoinfection, we sequenced 340 HCV clones from the HVR-1 and NS3 regions at two different time points in two groups of treatment-naïve patients with HCV-1a infection: (1) HIV–HCV positive (n = 6); and (2) HIV negative–HCV positive (n = 3). In HCV/HIV coinfection, we found a trend for reduced HCV genetic complexity and diversity, and a trend towards reduced dN/dS ratios in the HVR-1 region, especially in those patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3, who lost positive selective immune pressure in the HVR-1 region. Differences in immune regulation of HCV quasispecies in HIV coinfected individuals deserve further exploration to clarify the different outcomes of chronic hepatitis C noted between the immunocompromised and the immunocompetent host.

  Abstract                 = {Productive infection and successful replication of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) requires the balanced expression of all viral genes. This is achieved by a combination of alternative splicing events and regulated nuclear export of viral RNA. Because viral splicing is incomplete and intron-containing RNAs must be exported from the nucleus where they are normally retained, it must be ensured that the unspliced HIV-1 RNA is actively exported from the nucleus and protected from degradation by processes such as nonsense-mediated decay. Here we report the identification of a novel 178-nt-long exon located in the gag-pol gene of HIV-1 and its inclusion in at least two different mRNA species. Although efficiently spliced in vitro, this exon appears to be tightly repressed and infrequently used in vivo. The splicing is activated or repressed in vitro by the splicing factors ASF/SF2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, respectively, suggesting that splicing is controlled by these factors. Interestingly, mutations in the 5'-splice site resulted in a dramatic reduction in the steady-state level of HIV-1 RNA, and this effect was partially reversed by expression of U1 small nuclear RNA harboring the compensatory mutation. This implies that U1 small nuclear RNA binding to optimal but non-functional splice sites might have a role in protecting unspliced HIV-1 mRNA from degradation.},

DNA sequence analysis of the 4kb cDNA insert (pHE.1) revealed the presence of ORFs potentially coding for putative retrovirus-related gag, pol and env proteins. Northern blot and RNase protection experiments showed that RNA homologous to the pHE.1 insert is detected only in embryonal carcinoma cells as a 8 kb mRNA, and its expression is negatively regulated during retinoic acid induced differentiation of the human teratocarcinoma cell line NT2/D1. Using a pol specific probe we have isolated a genomic locus containing the ERV-9 sequences. Characterization by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing allowed us to define LTR-like sequences, that are composed by a complex array of subrepetitive elements. In addition we show that ERV-9 LTR sequences are capable to drive expression of linked CAT gene in a cell specific manner as LTR promoter activity has been detected only in NT2/D1 cells.},

In this report we have analyzed the minimal promoter region located within the ERV9 LTR. Using the transient CAT expression assay we have identified the minimal promoter region, which includes sequences spanning from -70 to +6 relative to the major transcription start site. Deletion analysis, primer extension mapping of the transcription start sites and DNA-protein interactions assays have allowed us to define two important regions within the ERV9 minimal promoter. One region located between -70 to -39 acts as a transcriptional activating sequence and contains an Sp 1 binding site. The second region from -7 to +6, which resembles an initiator element (Inr), was necessary for the correct transcription start site utilization, and binds to a regulatory protein. Cross-competition experiments using various Inr elements have indicated that the protein that binds to the ERV9 Inr element can be competed by the HIV-1 and TdT Inr sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {To address the activation and replicative activity of HERV-K102 in vivo associated with HIV viremia.Initially serology was performed on HERV-K102 specific envelope peptides to determine if HERV-K102 may become activated with HIV viremia. Before developing a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, we first determined whether plasma associated particles contained DNA or RNA genomes in a pilot study which surprisingly revealed predominantly DNA genomes. A relative, ddCt qPCR ratio method was then devised to detect excess levels of HERV-K102 pol DNA templates over genomic levels which served as a surrogate marker to reliably index the level of particles found in plasma.Both the peptide serology and ddCt qPCR excess ratio methods suggested the activation of HERV-K102 in about 70-80\% of HIV viremic cases whereas only 2-3\% of normal healthy adults had marginally activated HERV-K102 (P < 0.0001). Moreover, by digestion with dUTPase we were able to confirm that the vast majority of excess DNA template in plasma related to cDNA production rather than representing genomic copies.Our work uniquely suggests the common activation of HERV-K102 with HIV viremia and may be first to directly demonstrate HERV-K102 cDNA production in vivo. The potential implications of the induction of HERV-K102 activation and replication for the prevention and control of HIV are discussed.},

We show that many 21- and 22-nt expressed RNAs, termed microRNAs, exist in invertebrates and vertebrates and that some of these novel RNAs, similar to let-7 stRNA, are highly conserved.

  Abstract                 = {RNA-seq is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.We present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of over 1,000 in vitro transcribed RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with polyA and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length, and we show in vitro transcription is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find 50\% of transcripts have more than two-fold and 10\% have more than 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. We also find greater than 6\% of transcripts have regions of dramatically unpredictable sequencing coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. We use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage, and several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.These results show the utility of IVT-seq for promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq. We find rRNA depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage introduced during library preparation. These biases suggest exon-level expression analysis may be inadvisable, and we recommend caution when interpreting RNA-seq results.},

  Abstract                 = {PCR-mediated recombination can greatly impact estimates of diversity, both in environmental studies and in analyses of gene family evolution. Here we measure chimera (PCR-mediated recombinant) formation by analyzing a mixture of eight partial actin sequences isolated from the amoeba Arcella hemisphaerica amplified under a variety of conditions that mimic standard laboratory situations. We further compare a new-generation proofreading processivity-enhanced polymerase to both a standard proofreading enzyme and previously published results. Proofreading polymerases are preferred over other polymerases in instances where evolutionary inferences must be made. Our analyses reveal that reducing the initial template concentration is as critical as reducing the number of cycles for decreasing chimera formation and improving accuracy. Furthermore, assessing the efficiency of recovery of original haplotypes demonstrates that multiple PCR reactions are required to capture the actual genetic diversity of a sample. Finally, the experiments confirm that processivity-enhanced polymerases enable a substantial decrease in PCR-mediated recombination through reducing starting template concentration, without compromising the robustness of PCR reactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Reversal of HIV-1 latency by small molecules is a potential cure strategy. This approach will likely require effective drug combinations to achieve high levels of latency reversal. Using resting CD4+ T cells (rCD4s) from infected individuals, we developed an experimental and theoretical framework to identify effective latency-reversing agent (LRA) combinations. Utilizing ex vivo assays for intracellular HIV-1 mRNA and virion production, we compared 2-drug combinations of leading candidate LRAs and identified multiple combinations that effectively reverse latency. We showed that protein kinase C agonists in combination with bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 or histone deacetylase inhibitors robustly induce HIV-1 transcription and virus production when directly compared with maximum reactivation by T cell activation. Using the Bliss independence model to quantitate combined drug effects, we demonstrated that these combinations synergize to induce HIV-1 transcription. This robust latency reversal occurred without release of proinflammatory cytokines by rCD4s. To extend the clinical utility of our findings, we applied a mathematical model that estimates in vivo changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA from ex vivo measurements of virus production. Our study reconciles diverse findings from previous studies, establishes a quantitative experimental approach to evaluate combinatorial LRA efficacy, and presents a model to predict in vivo responses to LRAs.},

Such functional convergence strongly suggests that CD4 downregulation is critical for optimal viral replication, yet the significance of this phenomenon has so far remained a puzzle.We show that high levels of CD4 on the surface of HIV-infected cells induce a dramatic reduction in the infectivity of released virions by the sequestering of the viral envelope by CD4. CD4 is able to accumulate in viral particles while at the same time blocking incorporation of Env into the virion. Nef and Vpu, through their ability to downregulate CD4, counteract this effect.The CD4-mediated 'envelope interference' described here probably explains the plurality of mechanisms developed by HIV to downregulate the cell-surface expression of its receptor.},

In this study, the presence of infectious HIV was investigated in highly purified monocytes from 5 patients receiving HAART with undetectable plasma viral load for up to 16 months. HIV was detected in freshly isolated monocytes and recovered following Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation. No new drug resistance-associated mutation was found in monocyte-associated HIV. These results demonstrate the long-term persistence of infectious virus in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage in patients receiving HAART.

We find that each RNA-seq approach shows specific limitations and biases, with the application of multiple methods providing a more complete map than was obtained from any single method. Of particular note in the analysis were substantial advantages of CircLigase-based and ssRNA-based capture for defining sequences and structures of the precise 5' ends (which were lost using the double-strand cDNA capture method). Of the three methods, ssRNA capture was most effective in defining sequences to the poly(A) junction. Using data sets from a spectrum of C. elegans strains and stages and the UCSC Genome Browser, we provide a series of tools, which facilitate rapid visualization and assignment of gene structures.},

We present expression profiles derived from clone count data and provide computational tools for their analysis. Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the differences in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units, and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {We and others have recently demonstrated that the human retrovirus HTLV-I was producing a spliced antisense transcript, which led to the synthesis of the HBZ protein. The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the existence of antisense transcription in HIV-1 and to provide a better characterization of the transcript and its regulation.Initial experiments conducted by standard RT-PCR analysis in latently infected J1.1 cell line and pNL4.3-transfected 293T cells confirmed the existence of antisense transcription in HIV-1. A more adapted RT-PCR protocol with limited RT-PCR artefacts also led to a successful detection of antisense transcripts in several infected cell lines. RACE analyses demonstrated the existence of several transcription initiation sites mapping near the 5' border of the 3'LTR (in the antisense strand). Interestingly, a new polyA signal was identified on the antisense strand and harboured the polyA signal consensus sequence. Transfection experiments in 293T and Jurkat cells with an antisense luciferase-expressing NL4.3 proviral DNA showed luciferase reporter gene expression, which was further induced by various T-cell activators. In addition, the viral Tat protein was found to be a positive modulator of antisense transcription by transient and stable transfections of this proviral DNA construct. RT-PCR analyses in 293T cells stably transfected with a pNL4.3-derived construct further confirmed these results. Infection of 293T, Jurkat, SupT1, U937 and CEMT4 cells with pseudotyped virions produced from the antisense luciferase-expressing NL4.3 DNA clone led to the production of an AZT-sensitive luciferase signal, which was however less pronounced than the signal from NL4.3Luc-infected cells.These results demonstrate for the first time that antisense transcription exists in HIV-1 in the context of infection. Possible translation of the predicted antisense ORF in this transcript should thus be re-examined.},

Fifty percent inhibitory dose (ID50) values of 18 isolates from untreated individuals ranged between 0.01 microM and 0.05 microM. In contrast, most isolates from patients who had received zidovudine for 6 months or more exhibited decreased sensitivity characterized by changes in ID50 or ID95 values (or both), with isolates from several patients (5/15) showing 100-fold increases in ID50. The latter isolates were also insensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine; however, the isolates were still sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine, or phosphonoformate. It cannot be determined from this small sample of patients whether development of a less sensitive virus phenotype results in clinical resistance. Appearance of such variants was not associated with a consistent increase in viral p24 concentrations in patient plasma and did not herald any sudden deterioration in clinical status. More extensive studies are required to determine the clinical significance. Thus, it would be premature to alter any treatment protocols for HIV-infected individuals at present.},

  Abstract                 = {The reverse transcriptase enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the target for many inhibitors. Amino-acid substitutions in functional regions of the enzyme that abolish reverse transcriptase activity also prevent HIV-1 replication. But selection pressure by drugs such as AZT (3'-azido-3'deoxythymidine, zidovudine), ddI (2',3'-dideoxyinosine) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) causes outgrowth of resistant variants due to non-lethal mutations in the enzyme. Reports of synergy and lack of cross-resistance between reverse transcriptase inhibitors (refs 7, 9, 10, 12-14, 17, 18, 20, 21), plus the reversal of AZT resistance by mutations induced by ddI and NNRTIs, have indicated that specific drug combinations directed at reverse transcriptase might curtail resistance. Chow et al. extended this concept in a report that specific multiple combinations of resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase can significantly impair HIV-1 replication. They concluded that evolutionary limitations may exist to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance to inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. We report here that HIV-1 co-resistant to AZT, ddI and the NNRTI nevirapine can be readily selected in cell culture starting with dual AZT- and ddI-resistant virus. We found no evidence for 'replication incompatible' combinations of resistance mutations, although a mutation (M184-->V) conferring oxathiolane-cytosine nucleoside resistance in reverse transcriptase completely suppressed AZT resistance in a triple-resistant background. These in vitro observations suggest that triple drug combination therapy might ultimately result in co-resistant HIV-1, although they do not preclude assessment of such combinations for treatment of HIV-1 disease.},

Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region from five pairs of sensitive and resistant isolates identified three predicted amino acid substitutions common to all the resistant strains (Asp67----Asn, Lys70----Arg, Thr215----Phe or Tyr) plus a fourth in three isolates (Lys219----Gln). Partially resistant isolates had combinations of these four changes. An infectious molecular clone constructed with these four mutations in RT yielded highly resistant HIV after transfection of T cells. The reproducible nature of these mutations should make it possible to develop rapid assays to predict zidovudine resistance by performing polymerase chain reaction amplification of nucleic acid from peripheral blood lymphocytes, thereby circumventing current lengthy HIV isolation and sensitivity testing.},

Furthermore, AZT-3TC coresistance was not observed during extensive in vitro selection with both drugs. In vivo AZT-3TC combination therapy resulted in a markedly greater decreased in serum HIV-1 RNA concentrations than treatment with AZT alone, even though valine-184 mutants rapidly emerged. Most samples assessed from the combination group remained AZT sensitive at 24 weeks of therapy, consistent with in vitro mutation studies.},

Recently, latent viral genomes have been shown to reside within the introns of active host genes. Therefore, latency is not simply due to an inaccessibility of the integrated proviruses to the transcriptional machinery. Rather, latency might result from insufficient nuclear levels of the crucial activation-dependent host transcription factors required to overcome the transcriptional interference that is an automatic consequence of the nature of HIV-1 integration sites. In addition, resting cells lack sufficient levels of HIV-1 Tat and Tat-associated activation-dependent host factors that are necessary for processive transcription. Defects at consecutive steps of transcriptional initiation and elongation enable HIV-1 to remain hidden within resting CD4(+) T cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Latently infected cells form the major obstacle to HIV eradication. Studies of HIV latency have been generally hindered by the lack of a robust and rapidly deployable cell model that involves primary human CD4 T lymphocytes. Latently infected cell lines have proven useful, but it is unclear how closely these proliferating cells recapitulate the conditions of viral latency in non-dividing CD4 T lymphocytes in vivo. Current primary lymphocyte models more closely reflect the in vivo state of HIV latency, but they are limited by protracted culture periods and often low cell yields. Additionally, these models are always established in a single latently infected cell type that may not reflect the heterogeneous nature of the latent reservoir. Here we describe a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative primary cell model of HIV-1 latency with replication competent proviruses and multiple reporters to enhance the flexibility of the system. In this model, post-integration HIV-1 latency can be established in all populations of CD4 T cells, and reactivation of latent provirus assessed within 7 days. The kinetics and magnitude of reactivation were evaluated after stimulation with various cytokines, small molecules, and T-cell receptor agonists. Reactivation of latent HIV proviruses was readily detected in the presence of strong activators of NF-κB. Latently infected transitional memory CD4 T cells proved more responsive to these T-cell activators than latently infected central memory cells. These findings reveal potentially important biological differences within the latently infected pool of memory CD4 T cells and describe a flexible primary CD4 T-cell system to evaluate novel antagonists of HIV latency.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T cells represents a major barrier to virus eradication in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We describe here a novel post-transcriptional block in HIV-1 gene expression in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on HAART. This block involves the aberrant localization of multiply spliced (MS) HIV-1 RNAs encoding the critical positive regulators Tat and Rev. Although these RNAs had no previously described export defect, we show that they exhibit strict nuclear localization in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on HAART. Overexpression of the transcriptional activator Tat from non-HIV vectors allowed virus production in these cells. Thus, the nuclear retention of MS HIV-1 RNA interrupts a positive feedback loop and contributes to the non-productive nature of infection of resting CD4+ T cells. To define the mechanism of nuclear retention, proteomic analysis was used to identify proteins that bind MS HIV-1 RNA. Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) was identified as an HIV-1 RNA-binding protein differentially expressed in resting and activated CD4+ T cells. Overexpression of PTB in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on HAART allowed cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV-1 RNAs. PTB overexpression also induced virus production by resting CD4+ T cells. Virus culture experiments showed that overexpression of PTB in resting CD4+ T cells from patients on HAART allowed release of replication-competent virus, while preserving a resting cellular phenotype. Whether through effects on RNA export or another mechanism, the ability of PTB to reverse latency without inducing cellular activation is a result with therapeutic implications.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate potential mechanisms for HIV-1 proviral latency, we generated a set of chronically HIV-1 infected and stably long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (LTR-CAT)-transfected TE671/RD cells, and studied both their virus production and LTR-driven reporter gene expression. Established tissue culture models of retroviral latency in lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines have demonstrated that the induction of virus production is associated with a shift in HIV-1-specific mRNA from a predominance of singly and multiply spliced mRNA's to the production of full-length HIV-1 RNA. We found a similar pattern in TE671/RD cells, but in contrast to U1 and ACH2 cells, could not induce viral replication by exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) alone. We demonstrated instead that production of full-length viral RNA, viral replication, and LTR-driven CAT expression could be induced by exposure to sodium butyrate. The most proximate effect of sodium butyrate is inhibition of cellular histone deacetylase(s) which results in disruption of nucleosomes relieving one level of restriction to gene expression. Consistent with this mechanism of action, we further found that sodium butyrate's effects: (i) act synergistically with PMA and TNF-alpha; (ii) are independent of protein synthesis; (iii) do not affect the constitutively expressed creatine phosphokinase gene; (iv) do not map to a discrete sequence motif in the viral LTR; and (v) are not blocked by N-acetyl cysteine but (vi) are blocked by novobiocin, an inhibitor of cellular topoisomerase II. These data show that a similar pattern of restricted viral RNA expression exists in this nonlymphoid cellular model of HIV-1 latency. In contrast however, these results suggest that in these cells there is an additional block to viral gene expression, which is overcome with sodium butyrate. These results are discussed in the context of histone-mediated repression of HIV-1 gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of viral pathogenesis have relied heavily on analyses of specific clones and their genetic determinants of virulence. It is sometimes difficult to apply this reductionist approach to the study of RNA viruses, which by virtue of their very high mutation rates, exist as a complex mixture of mutants. While quasispecies theory has provided an intellectual framework for exploring the relationship between the viral population structure and phenotype, experimental studies have been limited by the relatively poor resolution of traditional sequencing-based approaches. We have addressed this problem by developing a molecular barcoding strategy in which viral subpopulations are tagged with unique 20-nucleotide sequences. The behavior of these subpopulations can be monitored using a universal barcode microarray. We demonstrate the performance of our barcode microarray platform using poliovirus, a model RNA virus. Using this platform, we explored the fitness landscape occupied by an artificial quasispecies consisting of 48 randomly mutagenized clones. We were able to rapidly derive precise fitness measurements for a majority of these clones and identified a neutral space surrounding the wild type. The experimental paradigm presented here is readily adaptable to other viral systems and can potentially be used to track thousands of variants in a cost-effective manner.},

These viruses replicate with extremely high mutation rates and exhibit significant genetic diversity. This diversity allows a viral population to rapidly adapt to dynamic environments and evolve resistance to vaccines and antiviral drugs. For the last 30 years, quasispecies theory has provided a population-based framework for understanding RNA viral evolution. A quasispecies is a cloud of diverse variants that are genetically linked through mutation, interact cooperatively on a functional level, and collectively contribute to the characteristics of the population. Many predictions of quasispecies theory run counter to traditional views of microbial behavior and evolution and have profound implications for our understanding of viral disease. Here, we discuss basic principles of quasispecies theory and describe its relevance for our understanding of viral fitness, virulence, and antiviral therapeutic strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in the human genome, and some are capable of generating new insertions through RNA intermediates. In cancer, the disruption of cellular mechanisms that normally suppress TE activity may facilitate mutagenic retrotranspositions. We performed single-nucleotide resolution analysis of TE insertions in 43 high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data sets from five cancer types. We identified 194 high-confidence somatic TE insertions, as well as thousands of polymorphic TE insertions in matched normal genomes. Somatic insertions were present in epithelial tumors but not in blood or brain cancers. Somatic L1 insertions tend to occur in genes that are commonly mutated in cancer, disrupt the expression of the target genes, and are biased toward regions of cancer-specific DNA hypomethylation, highlighting their potential impact in tumorigenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a mathematical model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of viral evolution during acute infection. We consider both synchronous and asynchronous processes of viral infection of new target cells. The model enables an assessment of the expected sequence diversity in new HIV-1 infections originating from a single transmitted viral strain, estimation of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the transmitted viral lineage, and estimation of the time to coalesce back to the MRCA. We also calculate the probability of the MRCA being the transmitted virus or an evolved variant. Excluding insertions and deletions, we assume HIV-1 evolves by base substitution without selection pressure during the earliest phase of HIV-1 infection prior to the immune response. Unlike phylogenetic methods that follow a lineage backwards to coalescence, we compare the observed data to a model of the diversification of a viral population forward in time. To illustrate the application of these methods, we provide detailed comparisons of the model and simulations results to 306 envelope sequences obtained from eight newly infected subjects at a single time point. The data from 68 patients were in good agreement with model predictions, and hence compatible with a single-strain infection evolving under no selection pressure. The diversity of the samples from the other two patients was too great to be explained by the model, suggesting multiple HIV-1-strains were transmitted. The model can also be applied to longitudinal patient data to estimate within-host viral evolutionary parameters.},

Too large for passive diffusion through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), PICs use cellular nuclear transport mechanisms and nucleoporins (NUPs), the NPC components that permit selective nuclear-cytoplasmic exchange, but the details remain unclear. Here we identify a fragment of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor 6, CPSF6, as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infection. When enriched in the cytoplasm, CPSF6 prevents HIV-1 nuclear entry by targeting the viral capsid (CA). HIV-1 harboring the N74D mutation in CA fails to interact with CPSF6 and evades the nuclear import restriction. Interestingly, whereas wild-type HIV-1 requires NUP153, N74D HIV-1 mimics feline immunodeficiency virus nuclear import requirements and is more sensitive to NUP155 depletion. These findings reveal a remarkable flexibility in HIV-1 nuclear transport and highlight a single residue in CA as essential in regulating interactions with NUPs.},

We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {The human genome represents a fossil record of ancient retroviruses that once replicated in the ancestors of contemporary humans. Indeed, approximately 8\% of human DNA is composed of sequences that are recognizably retroviral. Despite occasional reports associating human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) expression with human disease, almost all HERV genomes contain obviously inactivating mutations, and none are thought to be capable of replication. Nonetheless, one family of HERVs, namely HERV-K(HML-2), may have replicated in human ancestors less than 1 million years ago. By deriving a consensus sequence, we reconstructed a proviral clone (HERV-KCON) that likely resembles the progenitor of HERV-K(HML-2) variants that entered the human genome within the last few million years. We show that HERV-KCON Gag and protease proteins mediate efficient assembly and processing into retrovirus-like particles. Moreover, reporter genes inserted into the HERV-KCON genome and packaged into HERV-K particles are capable of infectious transfer and stable integration in a manner that requires reverse transcription. Additionally, we show that HERV-KCON Env is capable of pseudotyping HIV-1 particles and mediating entry into human and nonhuman cell lines. Furthermore, we show that HERV-KCON is resistant to inhibition by the human retrovirus restriction factors tripartite motif 5alpha and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) 3G but is inhibited by APOBEC 3F. Overall, the resurrection of this extinct infectious agent in a functional form from molecular fossils should enable studies of the molecular virology and pathogenic potential of this ancient human retrovirus.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to jointly analyze cellular and viral transcriptional activity without prerequisite knowledge of the nature of the transcripts. SupT1 cells were infected with a vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped HIV vector. At 24 h postinfection, both cellular and viral transcriptomes were analyzed by serial analysis of gene expression followed by high-throughput sequencing (SAGE-Seq). Read mapping resulted in 33 to 44 million tags aligning with the human transcriptome and 0.23 to 0.25 million tags aligning with the genome of the HIV-1 vector. Thus, at peak infection, 1 transcript in 143 is of viral origin (0.7\%), including a small component of antisense viral transcription. Of the detected cellular transcripts, 826 (2.3\%) were differentially expressed between mock- and HIV-infected samples. The approach also assessed whether HIV-1 infection modulates the expression of repetitive elements or endogenous retroviruses. We observed very active transcription of these elements, with 1 transcript in 237 being of such origin, corresponding on average to 123,123 reads in mock-infected samples (0.40\%) and 129,149 reads in HIV-1-infected samples (0.45\%) mapping to the genomic Repbase repository. This analysis highlights key details in the generation and interpretation of high-throughput data in the setting of HIV-1 cellular infection.},

  Abstract                 = {We designed a strategy to identify splicing factors that act by preventing pre-mRNA transport into the cytoplasm. A yeast synthetic intron was inserted into a lacZ gene so that only the pre-mRNA could be translated to produce beta-galactosidase activity. Deletion of either of the 5' splice junction sequence GUAUGU and the branchpoint sequence UACUAAC resulted in a dramatic increase in pre-mRNA translation, indicating its cytoplasmic localization. In rna6 and rna9 mutant strains assayed at the nonpermissive temperature, splicing inhibition occurred simultaneously with a large increase in pre-mRNA translation. Similarly, a point mutation in U1 snRNA decreased splicing efficiency and increased pre-mRNA translation. From these results, we conclude that early acting factors, probably including U1 snRNA, and the RNA6 and RNA9 gene products, interact in vivo with the 5' splice junction and the branchpoint sequence to commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway, thereby preventing its transport to the cytoplasm.},

  Abstract                 = {Persistent infection in resting CD4+ T cells prevents eradication of HIV-1. Since the chromatin remodeling enzyme histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) maintains latency of integrated HIV, we tested the ability of the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid to deplete persistent, latent infection in resting CD4+ T cells.We did a proof-of-concept study in four volunteers infected with HIV and on highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). After intensifying the effect of HAART with subcutaneous enfuvirtide 90 mug twice daily for 4-6 weeks to prevent the spread of HIV, we added oral valproic acid 500-750 mg twice daily to their treatment regimen for 3 months. We quantified latent infection of resting CD4+ T cells before and after augmented treatment by limiting-dilution culture of resting CD4+ T cells after ex-vivo activation.The frequency of resting cell infection was stable before addition of enfuvirtide and valproic acid, but declined thereafter. This decline was significant in three of four patients (mean reduction 75\%, range 68\% to >84\%). Patients had slight reactions to enfuvirtide at the injection site, but otherwise tolerated treatment well.Combination therapy with an HDAC inhibitor and intensified HAART safely accelerates clearance of HIV from resting CD4+ T cells in vivo, suggesting a new and practical approach to eliminate HIV infection in this persistent reservoir. This finding, though not definitive, suggests that new approaches will allow the cure of HIV in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Eradication of the latent HIV reservoir remains a major barrier to curing AIDS. However, the mechanisms that direct viral persistence in the host are not well understood. Studying a model system of postintegration latency, we found that viral integration into the actively transcribed host genes led to transcriptional interference (TI) caused by the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribing through the viral promoter. The resulting physical exclusion of preinitiation complex formation on the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) promoted the silencing of HIV transcription. This block could be counteracted by inhibiting the upstream transcription or cooperatively activating viral transcription initiation and elongation. Importantly, PCR-based analysis, which detects host transcription through the 5'LTR independently of the viral integration site, revealed substantial levels of this transcription in HIV-infected primary CD4(+) T cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that TI contributes significantly to HIV latency and should be considered when attempting to purge the latent reservoir.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic variation in coding regions is of strong interest for biologists as it represents an important factor that drives evolution. To analyse polymorphic loci, researchers usually rely on commonly used typing techniques such as cloning, SSCP, DGGE or RSCA. However, there are potential pitfalls in screening multi-allelic templates, which are mainly the formation of sequence chimeras during PCR amplification, and mosaic sequences during cloning. One of the most challenging genomic regions to explore is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which codes for peptide-binding proteins of the vertebrate's adaptive immune system and is well known for its exceptional polymorphism. We compared the effect of two different PCR amplification approaches in a study of the MHC class IIB genes of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). One approach used standard PCR conditions and the other a combination of several measures to eliminate PCR artefacts. In both approaches, the amplicons obtained were cloned and sequenced. In the first, established approach, 24\% of the clones represented artefacts, while in the second approach the number of artefacts were reduced ten-fold. Furthermore, it enabled easy differentiation between real alleles and artificial sequences. We also analysed the potential effects of such artefacts in genetic analysis and evolutionary interpretation, and found a slight reduction in the signature of positive selection and an increase in recombination events. Consequently, we strongly recommend to apply the new PCR approach described in this study when genotyping MHC or other polymorphic genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus, of the Retrovirus family, with an almost worldwide distribution, infecting equids. It causes a persistent infection characterized by recurring febrile episodes associating viremia, fever, thrombocytopenia, and wasting symptoms. The disease is experimentally reproducible by inoculation of Shetland ponies or horses with EIAV pathogenic strains. Among lentiviruses, EIAV is unique in that, despite a rapid virus replication and antigenic variation, most animals progress from a chronic stage characterized by recurring peaks of viremia and fever to an asymptomatic stage of infection. The inapparent carriers remain infective for life, as demonstrated by experimental transfer of blood to naive animals. The understanding of the correlates of this immune control is of great interest in defining vaccine strategies. Research on EIAV, this "country cousin" of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), over the last five decades has produced some interesting results on natural immunological control of lentivirus replication and disease and on the nature and role of virus variation in persistence and pathogenesis. These studies are of interest in the context of HIV and efforts to develop a vaccine. This review will focus on some of the most recent results.},

Affected animals died with lymphomas (a rare disease in macaques) or such opportunistic infections as Pneumocystis carinii and noma (necrotizing gingivitis). These M. cyclopis exhibited anemia, neutropenia, and a circulating bizarre immature monocyte. In addition, liver function tests suggested hepatitis. Pokeweed mitogen-, concanavalin A-, and xenogeneic cell-stimulated proliferative responses by lymphocytes of animals with the syndrome were dramatically diminished. The T4 (helper, inducer)/T8 (suppressor, cytotoxic) ratio in the peripheral blood mononuclear T-cell populations of M. cyclopis in this colony are decreased when compared with those from either Macaca mulatta in the same colony or normal humans. Epidemiologic evidence implicates a common source agent in this syndrome. The similarity of this syndrome in macaques to human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suggests that it may provide an important model for studying the human syndrome.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomic RNA is necessary to produce the complete viral protein complement, and aberrations in the splicing pattern impair HIV-1 replication. Genome splicing in HIV-1 is tightly regulated by the dynamic assembly/disassembly of trans host factors with cis RNA control elements. The host protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, regulates splicing at several highly conserved HIV-1 3' splice sites by binding 5'-UAG-3' elements embedded within regions containing RNA structure. The physical determinants of hnRNP A1 splice site recognition remain poorly defined in HIV-1, thus precluding a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of the splicing pattern. Here, the three-dimensional structure of the exon splicing silencer 3 (ESS3) from HIV-1 has been determined using NMR spectroscopy. ESS3 adopts a 27-nucleotide hairpin with a 10-bp A-form stem that contains a pH-sensitive A(+)C wobble pair. The seven-nucleotide hairpin loop contains the high-affinity hnRNP-A1-responsive 5'-UAGU-3' element and a proximal 5'-GAU-3' motif. The NMR structure shows that the heptaloop adopts a well-organized conformation stabilized primarily by base stacking interactions reminiscent of a U-turn. The apex of the loop is quasi-symmetric with UA dinucleotide steps from the 5'-GAU-3' and 5'-UAGU-3' motifs stacking on opposite sides of the hairpin. As a step towards understanding the binding mechanism, we performed calorimetric and NMR titrations of several hnRNP A1 subdomains into ESS3. The data show that the UP1 domain forms a high-affinity (K(d)=37.8±1.1 nM) complex with ESS3 via site-specific interactions with the loop.},

  Abstract                 = {Strand-specific, massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool for transcript discovery, genome annotation and expression profiling. There are multiple published methods for strand-specific RNA-seq, but no consensus exists as to how to choose between them. Here we developed a comprehensive computational pipeline to compare library quality metrics from any RNA-seq method. Using the well-annotated Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome as a benchmark, we compared seven library-construction protocols, including both published and our own methods. We found marked differences in strand specificity, library complexity, evenness and continuity of coverage, agreement with known annotations and accuracy for expression profiling. Weighing each method's performance and ease, we identified the dUTP second-strand marking and the Illumina RNA ligation methods as the leading protocols, with the former benefitting from the current availability of paired-end sequencing. Our analysis provides a comprehensive benchmark, and our computational pipeline is applicable for assessment of future protocols in other organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated regulatory sequences in noncoding human DNA that are associated with repression of an integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter. HIV-1 integration results in the formation of precise and homogeneous junctions between viral and host DNA, but integration takes place at many locations. Thus, the variation in HIV-1 gene expression at different integration sites reports the activity of regulatory sequences at nearby chromosomal positions. Negative regulation of HIV transcription is of particular interest because of its association with maintaining HIV in a latent state in cells from infected patients. To identify chromosomal regulators of HIV transcription, we infected Jurkat T cells with an HIV-based vector transducing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and separated cells into populations containing well-expressed (GFP-positive) or poorly expressed (GFP-negative) proviruses. We then determined the chromosomal locations of the two classes by sequencing 971 junctions between viral and cellular DNA. Possible effects of endogenous cellular transcription were characterized by transcriptional profiling. Low-level GFP expression correlated with integration in (i) gene deserts, (ii) centromeric heterochromatin, and (iii) very highly expressed cellular genes. These data provide a genome-wide picture of chromosomal features that repress transcription and suggest models for transcriptional latency in cells from HIV-infected patients.},

Each isoform was classified according to its splice pattern and supporting evidence. We found that one-third of the alternative transcripts examined contain premature termination codons, and most persist even after rigorous filtering by multiple methods. These transcripts are apparent targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance mechanism that selectively degrades nonsense mRNAs. Several of these transcripts are from genes for which alternative splicing is known to regulate protein expression by generating alternate isoforms that are differentially subjected to NMD. We propose that regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST), through the coupling of alternative splicing and NMD, may be a pervasive, underappreciated means of regulating protein expression.},

The treatment of this disease has changed little in the past two decades, because most of the genetic events that initiate the disease remain undiscovered. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible at a reasonable cost and timeframe to use this approach for the unbiased discovery of tumour-specific somatic mutations that alter the protein-coding genes. Here we present the results obtained from sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukaemia genome, and its matched normal counterpart obtained from the same patient's skin. We discovered ten genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations that are thought to contribute to tumour progression, and eight were new mutations present in virtually all tumour cells at presentation and relapse, the function of which is not yet known. Our study establishes whole-genome sequencing as an unbiased method for discovering cancer-initiating mutations in previously unidentified genes that may respond to targeted therapies.},

  Abstract                 = {Elucidating virus-host interactions responsible for HIV-1 transmission is important for advancing HIV-1 prevention strategies. To this end, single genome amplification (SGA) and sequencing of HIV-1 within the context of a model of random virus evolution has made possible for the first time an unambiguous identification of transmitted/founder viruses and a precise estimation of their numbers. Here, we applied this approach to HIV-1 env analyses in a cohort of acutely infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and found that a high proportion (10 of 28; 36\%) had been productively infected by more than one virus. In subjects with multivariant transmission, the minimum number of transmitted viruses ranged from 2 to 10 with viral recombination leading to rapid and extensive genetic shuffling among virus lineages. A combined analysis of these results, together with recently published findings based on identical SGA methods in largely heterosexual (HSX) cohorts, revealed a significantly higher frequency of multivariant transmission in MSM than in HSX [19 of 50 subjects (38\%) versus 34 of 175 subjects (19\%); Fisher's exact p = 0.008]. To further evaluate the SGA strategy for identifying transmitted/founder viruses, we analyzed 239 overlapping 5' and 3' half genome or env-only sequences from plasma viral RNA (vRNA) and blood mononuclear cell DNA in an MSM subject who had a particularly well-documented virus exposure history 3-6 days before symptom onset and 14-17 days before peak plasma viremia (47,600,000 vRNA molecules/ml). All 239 sequences coalesced to a single transmitted/founder virus genome in a time frame consistent with the clinical history, and a molecular clone of this genome encoded replication competent virus in accord with model predictions. Higher multiplicity of HIV-1 infection in MSM compared with HSX is consistent with the demonstrably higher epidemiological risk of virus acquisition in MSM and could indicate a greater challenge for HIV-1 vaccines than previously recognized.},

  Abstract                 = {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site.

  Abstract                 = {Since the inception of next-generation mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology, various attempts have been made to utilize RNA-Seq data in assembling full-length mRNA isoforms de novo and estimating abundance of isoforms. However, for genes with more than a few exons, the problem tends to be challenging and often involves identifiability issues in statistical modeling. We have developed a statistical method called "sparse linear modeling of RNA-Seq data for isoform discovery and abundance estimation" (SLIDE) that takes exon boundaries and RNA-Seq data as input to discern the set of mRNA isoforms that are most likely to present in an RNA-Seq sample. SLIDE is based on a linear model with a design matrix that models the sampling probability of RNA-Seq reads from different mRNA isoforms. To tackle the model unidentifiability issue, SLIDE uses a modified Lasso procedure for parameter estimation. Compared with deterministic isoform assembly algorithms (e.g., Cufflinks), SLIDE considers the stochastic aspects of RNA-Seq reads in exons from different isoforms and thus has increased power in detecting more novel isoforms. Another advantage of SLIDE is its flexibility of incorporating other transcriptomic data such as RACE, CAGE, and EST into its model to further increase isoform discovery accuracy. SLIDE can also work downstream of other RNA-Seq assembly algorithms to integrate newly discovered genes and exons. Besides isoform discovery, SLIDE sequentially uses the same linear model to estimate the abundance of discovered isoforms. Simulation and real data studies show that SLIDE performs as well as or better than major competitors in both isoform discovery and abundance estimation. The SLIDE software package is available at https://sites.google.com/site/jingyijli/SLIDE.zip.},

  Abstract                 = {The noninfectious HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rat was developed as a model of AIDs-related pathology and immune dysfunction by manipulation of a noninfectious HIV-1(gag-pol) virus with a deleted 3-kb SphI-MscI fragment containing the 3' -region of gag and the 5' region of pol into F344 rats. Our previous studies revealed significant behavioral differences between HIV-1Tg and F344 control rats in their performance in the Morris water maze and responses to psychostimulants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these behavioral differences remain largely unknown. The primary goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways affected by the gag-pol-deleted HIV-1 genome. Using RNA deep sequencing, we sequenced RNA transcripts in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of HIV-1Tg and F344 rats. A total of 72 RNA samples were analyzed (i.e., 12 animals per group × 2 strains × 3 brain regions). Following deep-sequencing analysis of 50-bp paired-end reads of RNA-Seq, we used Bowtie/Tophat/Cufflinks suites to align these reads into transcripts based on the Rn4 rat reference genome and to measure the relative abundance of each transcript. Statistical analyses on each brain region in the two strains revealed that immune response- and neurotransmission-related pathways were altered in the HIV-1Tg rats, with brain region differences. Other neuronal survival-related pathways, including those encoding myelin proteins, growth factors, and translation regulators, were altered in the HIV-1Tg rats in a brain region-dependent manner. This study is the first deep-sequencing analysis of RNA transcripts associated the HIV-1Tg rat. Considering the functions of the pathways and brain regions examined in this study, our findings of abnormal gene expression patterns in HIV-1Tg rats suggest mechanisms underlying the deficits in learning and memory and vulnerability to drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders observed in HIV-positive patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Untreated HIV-1 infection progresses through acute and asymptomatic stages to AIDS. Although each of the three stages has well-known clinical, virologic, and immunologic characteristics, much less is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying each stage. In this study, we report lymphatic tissue microarray analyses, revealing for the first time stage-specific patterns of gene expression during HIV-1 infection. We show that although there is a common set of key genes with altered expression throughout all stages, each stage has a unique gene expression signature. The acute stage is most notably characterized by increased expression of hundreds of genes involved in immune activation, innate immune defenses (e.g., RIG-1, MDA-5, TLR7 and TLR8, PKR, APOBEC3B, 3F, 3G), adaptive immunity, and in the proapoptotic Fas-Fas ligand pathway. Yet, quite strikingly, the expression of nearly all acute stage genes return to baseline levels in the asymptomatic stage, accompanying partial control of infection. This transition from acute to asymptomatic stage is tied to increased expression of a diverse array of immunosuppressive genes (e.g., CLEC12B, ILT4, galectin-3, CD160, BCMA, FGL2, LAG3, GPNMB). In the AIDS stage, decreased expression of numerous genes involved in T cell signaling identifies genes contributing to T cell dysfunction. These common and stage-specific gene expression signatures identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying the host response and the slow, natural course of HIV-1 infection.},

In vitro, CA spontaneously assembles into helical tubes and cones that resemble authentic viral capsids. Here we describe electron cryo-microscopy and image reconstructions of CA tubes from six different helical families. In spite of their polymorphism, all tubes are composed of hexameric rings of CA arranged with approximate local p6 lattice symmetry. Crystal structures of the two CA domains were 'docked' into the reconstructed density, which showed that the amino-terminal domains form the hexameric rings and the carboxy-terminal dimerization domains connect each ring to six neighbours. We propose a molecular model for the HIV-1 capsid that follows the principles of a fullerene cone, in which the body of the cone is composed of curved hexagonal arrays of CA rings and the ends are closed by inclusion of 12 pentagonal 'defects'.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2-5A system is an interferon-regulated RNA degradation pathway with antiviral, growth-inhibitory, and pro-apoptotic activities. RNase-L mediates the antiviral activity through the degradation of viral RNAs, and the anticellular effects of the 2-5A system are thought to be similarly mediated through the degradation of cellular transcripts. However, specific RNase-L-regulated cellular RNAs have not been identified. To isolate candidate RNase-L substrates, differential display was used to identify mRNAs that exhibited increased expression in RNase-L-deficient N1E-115 cells as compared with RNase-L-transfected cells. A novel interferon-stimulated gene encoding a 43-kDa ubiquitin-specific protease, designated ISG43, was identified in this screen. ISG43 expression is induced by interferon and negatively regulated by RNase-L. ISG43 induction is a primary response to interferon treatment and requires a functional JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The kinetics of ISG43 induction were identical in wild type and RNase-L knock-out fibroblasts; however, the decline in ISG43 mRNA following interferon treatment was markedly attenuated in RNase-L knock-out fibroblasts. The delayed shut-off kinetics of ISG43 mRNA corresponded to an increase in its half-life in RNase-L-deficient cells. ISG15 mRNA also displayed RNase-L-dependent regulation. These findings identify a novel role for the 2-5A system in the attenuation of the interferon response.},

HITS-CLIP analysis of the neuron-specific splicing factor Nova revealed extremely reproducible RNA-binding maps in multiple mouse brains. These maps provide genome-wide in vivo biochemical footprints confirming the previous prediction that the position of Nova binding determines the outcome of alternative splicing; moreover, they are sufficiently powerful to predict Nova action de novo. HITS-CLIP revealed a large number of Nova-RNA interactions in 3' untranslated regions, leading to the discovery that Nova regulates alternative polyadenylation in the brain. HITS-CLIP, therefore, provides a robust, unbiased means to identify functional protein-RNA interactions in vivo.},

At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

Viral antigen-positive multinucleated giant cells have also been observed in histological sections from infected individuals. In vitro, formation of these multinucleated giant cells occurs through cell fusion which is dependent on cell-surface expression of the differentiation antigen CD4. Utilizing a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the gene for the envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-III/LAV, we demonstrate that cell-surface expression of this protein, in the absence of other HTLV-III/LAV structural or regulatory proteins, is sufficient to induce CD4-dependent cell fusion, leading to cell death, one of the characteristic manifestations of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) virus cytopathology. This process may contribute to the loss of CD4+ T cells seen in AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {The formation of multinucleated giant cells with progression to cell death is a characteristic manifestation of the cytopathology induced by the AIDS retrovirus in infected T lymphoid cells. The mechanism of giant cell formation was studied in the CD4 (T4/Leu 3) positive T cell lines JM (Jurkat) and VB and in variants of these lines that are negative for cell surface CD4 antigen. By means of a two-color fluorescent labeling technique, multinucleated giant cells in infected cultures were shown to form through cell fusion. Antibody to CD4 specifically inhibited fusion, and uninfected CD4 negative cells, in contrast to uninfected CD4 positive cells, did not undergo fusion with infected cells, suggesting a direct role for the CD4 antigen in the process of syncytium formation. These results suggest that, in vivo, cell fusion involving the CD4 molecule may represent a mechanism whereby uninfected cells can be incorporated into AIDS virus infected syncytia. Because the giant cells die soon after they are formed, this process may contribute to the depletion of helper/inducer T cells characteristically observed in AIDS.},

We also demonstrate that the retroviral nuclear transcription factors HIV-1 Tat and HTLV-1 Tax, as well as the Tas transactivator encoded by primate foamy virus, fail to inhibit RNA interference in human cells. Moreover, the stable expression of physiological levels of HIV-1 Tat did not globally inhibit microRNA production or expression in infected human cells. Together, these data argue that HIV-1 and HTLV-1 neither induce the production of viral small interfering RNAs or microRNAs nor repress the cellular RNA interference machinery in infected cells.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: As more non-coding RNAs are discovered, the importance of methods for RNA analysis increases. Since the structure of ncRNA is intimately tied to the function of the molecule, programs for RNA structure prediction are necessary tools in this growing field of research. Furthermore, it is known that RNA structure is often evolutionarily more conserved than sequence. However, few existing methods are capable of simultaneously considering multiple sequence alignment and structure prediction. RESULT: We present a novel solution to the problem of simultaneous structure prediction and multiple alignment of RNA sequences. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo in a simulated annealing framework, the algorithm MASTR (Multiple Alignment of STructural RNAs) iteratively improves both sequence alignment and structure prediction for a set of RNA sequences. This is done by minimizing a combined cost function that considers sequence conservation, covariation and basepairing probabilities. The results show that the method is very competitive to similar programs available today, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

  Abstract                 = {The solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs) of ERV-9 endogenous retrovirus contain the U3, R, and U5 regions but no internal viral genes. They are middle repetitive DNAs present at 2,000 to 4,000 copies in primate genomes. Sequence analyses of the 5" boundary area of the erythroid beta-globin locus control region (beta-LCR) and the intron of the embryonic axin gene show that a solitary ERV-9 LTR has been stably integrated in the respective loci for at least 15 million years in the higher primates from orangutan to human. Functional studies utilizing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as the reporter in transfection experiments show that the U3 region of the LTRs possesses strong enhancer activity in embryonic cells of widely different tissue origins and in adult cells of blood lineages. In both the genomic LTRs of embryonic placental cells and erythroid K562 cells and transfected LTRs of recombinant GFP plasmids in K562 cells, the U3 enhancer activates synthesis of RNAs that are initiated from a specific site 25 bases downstream of the AATAAA (TATA) motif in the U3 promoter. A second AATAAA motif in the R region does not serve as the TATA box or as the polyadenylation signal. The LTR-initiated RNAs extend through the R and U5 regions into the downstream genomic DNA. The results suggest that the ERV-9 LTR-initiated transcription process may modulate transcription of the associated gene loci in embryonic and hematopoietic cells.},

  Abstract                 = {A solitary long terminal repeat (LTR) of ERV-9 human endogenous retrovirus is located upstream of the HS5 site in the human beta-globin locus control region and possesses unique enhancer activity in erythroid K562 cells. In cells transfected with plasmid LTR-HS5-epsilonp-GFP, the LTR enhancer activates the GFP reporter gene and is not blocked by the interposed HS5 site, which has been reported to have insulator function. The LTR enhancer initiates synthesis of long RNAs from the LTR promoter through the intervening HS5 site into the epsilon-globin promoter and the GFP gene. Synthesis of the sense, long LTR RNAs is correlated with high level synthesis of GFP mRNA from the epsilon-globin promoter. Mutations of the LTR promoter and/or the epsilon-globin promoter show that (i) the LTR enhancer can autonomously initiate synthesis of LTR RNAs independent of the promoters and (ii) the LTR RNAs are not processed into GFP mRNA or translated into GFP. However, reversing the orientation of the LTR in plasmid (LTR)rev-HS5-epsilonp-GFP, thus reversing the direction of synthesis of LTR RNAs in the antisense direction away from the epsilon-globin promoter and GFP gene drastically reduces the level of GFP mRNA and thus LTR enhancer function. The results suggest that the LTR-assembled transcription machinery in synthesizing non-coding, LTR RNAs can reach the downstream epsilon-globin promoter to activate transcription of the GFP gene.},

Using sequencing-by-synthesis technology we directly sequenced the cytosine methylome (methylC-seq), transcriptome (mRNA-seq), and small RNA transcriptome (smRNA-seq) to generate highly integrated epigenome maps for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and mutants defective in DNA methyltransferase or demethylase activity. At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.},

  Abstract                 = {Complex interacting systems exhibit system behavior that is often not predictable from the properties of the component parts. We have tested a particular system property, that of robustness. The behavior of a system is termed robust if that behavior is qualitatively normal in the face of substantial changes to the system components. Here we test whether the behavior of the phage lambda gene regulatory circuitry is robust. This circuitry can exist in two alternative patterns of gene expression, and can switch from one regulatory state to the other. These states are stabilized by the action at the O(R) region of two regulatory proteins, CI and Cro, which bind with differential affinities to the O(R)1 and O(R)3 sites, such that each represses the synthesis of the other one. In this work, this pattern of binding was altered by making three mutant phages in which O(R)1 and O(R)3 were identical. These variants had the same qualitative in vivo patterns of gene expression as wild type. We conclude that the behavior of the lambda circuitry is highly robust. Based on these and other results, we propose a two-step pathway, in which robustness plays a key role, for evolution of complex regulatory circuitry.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple, point of care, inexpensive, disposable cassette for the detection of nucleic acids extracted from pathogens was designed, constructed, and tested. The cassette utilizes a single reaction chamber for isothermal amplification of nucleic acids. The chamber is equipped with an integrated, flow-through, Flinders Technology Associates (Whatman FTA®) membrane for the isolation, concentration, and purification of DNA and/or RNA. The nucleic acids captured by the membrane are used directly as templates for amplification without elution, thus simplifying the cassette's flow control. The FTA membrane also serves another critical role-enabling the removal of inhibitors that dramatically reduce detection sensitivity. Thermal control is provided with a thin film heater external to the cassette. The amplification process was monitored in real time with a portable, compact fluorescent reader. The utility of the integrated, single-chamber cassette was demonstrated by detecting the presence of HIV-1 in oral fluids. The HIV RNA was reverse transcribed and subjected to loop-mediated, isothermal amplification (LAMP). A detection limit of less than 10 HIV particles was demonstrated. The cassette is particularly suitable for resource poor regions, where funds and trained personnel are in short supply. The cassette can be readily modified to detect nucleic acids associated with other pathogens borne in saliva, urine, and other body fluids as well as in water and food.},

  Abstract                 = {Often, high-sensitivity, point-of-care (POC) clinical tests, such as HIV viral load, require large volumes of plasma. Although centrifuges are ubiquitously used in clinical laboratories to separate plasma from whole blood, centrifugation is generally inappropriate for on-site testing. Suitable alternatives are not readily available to separate the relatively large volumes of plasma from milliliters of blood that may be needed to meet stringent limit-of-detection specifications for low-abundance target molecules. We report on a simple-to-use, low-cost, pump-free, membrane-based, sedimentation-assisted plasma separator capable of separating a relatively large volume of plasma from undiluted whole blood within minutes. This plasma separator consists of an asymmetric, porous, polysulfone membrane housed in a disposable chamber. The separation process takes advantage of both gravitational sedimentation of blood cells and size exclusion-based filtration. The plasma separator demonstrated a "blood in-plasma out" capability, consistently extracting 275 ± 33.5 μL of plasma from 1.8 mL of undiluted whole blood within less than 7 min. The device was used to separate plasma laden with HIV viruses from HIV virus-spiked whole blood with recovery efficiencies of 95.5\% ± 3.5\%, 88.0\% ± 9.5\%, and 81.5\% ± 12.1\% for viral loads of 35,000, 3500, and 350 copies/mL, respectively. The separation process is self-terminating to prevent excessive hemolysis. The HIV-laden plasma was then injected into our custom-made microfluidic chip for nucleic acid testing and was successfully subjected to reverse-transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), demonstrating that the plasma is sufficiently pure to support high-efficiency nucleic acid amplification.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time amplification and quantification of specific nucleic acid sequences plays a major role in medical and biotechnological applications. In the case of infectious diseases, such as HIV, quantification of the pathogen-load in patient specimens is critical to assess disease progression and effectiveness of drug therapy. Typically, nucleic acid quantification requires expensive instruments, such as real-time PCR machines, which are not appropriate for on-site use and for low-resource settings. This paper describes a simple, low-cost, reaction-diffusion based method for end-point quantification of target nucleic acids undergoing enzymatic amplification. The number of target molecules is inferred from the position of the reaction-diffusion front, analogous to reading temperature in a mercury thermometer. The method was tested for HIV viral load monitoring and performed on par with conventional benchtop methods. The proposed method is suitable for nucleic acid quantification at point of care, compatible with multiplexing and high-throughput processing, and can function instrument-free.},

  Abstract                 = {Point mutations can generate defective and sometimes harmful proteins. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway minimizes the potential damage caused by nonsense mutations. In-frame nonsense codons located at a minimum distance upstream of the last exon-exon junction are recognized as premature termination codons (PTCs), targeting the mRNA for degradation. Some nonsense mutations cause skipping of one or more exons, presumably during pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus; this phenomenon is termed nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS), and its underlying mechanism is unclear. By analyzing NAS in BRCA1, we show here that inappropriate exon skipping can be reproduced in vitro, and results from disruption of a splicing enhancer in the coding sequence. Enhancers can be disrupted by single nonsense, missense and translationally silent point mutations, without recognition of an open reading frame as such. These results argue against a nuclear reading-frame scanning mechanism for NAS. Coding-region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) within exonic splicing enhancers or silencers may affect the patterns or efficiency of mRNA splicing, which may in turn cause phenotypic variability and variable penetrance of mutations elsewhere in a gene.},

We exploit CUDA-compatible graphics hardware as accelerators to achieve fast speed. Our algorithm uses a quality-aware bounded search approach based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini index to reduce the search space and achieve high alignment quality. Performance evaluation, using simulated as well as real short read datasets, reveals that our algorithm running on one or two graphics processing units achieves significant speedups in terms of execution time, while yielding comparable or even better alignment quality for paired-end alignments compared with three popular BWT-based aligners: Bowtie, BWA and SOAP2.

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.

  Abstract                 = {Muscle was one of the first tissues in which alternative splicing was widely observed. Cloning and sequencing of muscle-derived cDNAs in the early 1980's revealed that many of the abundant contractile proteins arise by alternative splicing of genes that are more widely expressed. Consequently alternative splicing events in contractile protein genes have long been used as models to dissect the mechanisms of alternative splicing. Transcriptomic and computational analyses have complemented traditional molecular analyses of alternative splicing in muscle and other tissues, illuminating the general underlying principles of coregulated splicing programs. This has culminated in the first attempt to computationally predict tissue-specific changes in splicing. Investigations of myotonic dystrophy (DM), in which CUG expansion RNA leads to misregulated splicing in muscle, have enhanced our understanding of developmentally regulated splicing and led to the development of promising therapeutic strategies based on targeting the toxic RNA repeats.},

  Abstract                 = {A single dose of nevirapine during labor reduces perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) but often leads to viral nevirapine resistance mutations in mothers and infants.We studied the response to nevirapine-based antiretroviral treatment among women and infants who had previously been randomly assigned to a single, peripartum dose of nevirapine or placebo in a trial in Botswana involving the prevention of the transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child. All women were treated with antenatal zidovudine. The primary end point for mothers and infants was virologic failure by the 6-month visit after initiation of antiretroviral treatment, estimated within groups by the Kaplan-Meier method.Of 218 women who started antiretroviral treatment, 112 had received a single dose of nevirapine and 106 had received placebo. By the 6-month visit after the initiation of antiretroviral treatment, 5.0\% of the women who had received placebo had virologic failure, as compared with 18.4\% of those who had received a single dose of nevirapine (P=0.002). Among 60 women starting antiretroviral treatment within 6 months after receiving placebo or a single dose of nevirapine, no women in the placebo group and 41.7\% in the nevirapine group had virologic failure (P<0.001). In contrast, virologic failure rates did not differ significantly between the placebo group and the nevirapine group among 158 women starting antiretroviral treatment 6 months or more post partum (7.8\% and 12.0\%, respectively; P=0.39). Thirty infants also began antiretroviral treatment (15 in the placebo group and 15 in the nevirapine group). Virologic failure by the 6-month visit occurred in significantly more infants who had received a single dose of nevirapine than in infants who had received placebo (P<0.001). Maternal and infant findings did not change qualitatively by 12 and 24 months after the initiation of antiretroviral treatment.Women who received a single dose of nevirapine to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV-1 had higher rates of virologic failure with subsequent nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy than did women without previous exposure to nevirapine. However, this applied only when nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy was initiated within 6 months after receipt of a single, peripartum dose of nevirapine.

Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient's HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005.3990 HIV-infected patients and 379,872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22,744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2,689,287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95\% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16\%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age.The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years.The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era. However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reduce mortality rates for these persons compared with the general population.},

It unknown whether the health benefits and costs of routine nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) are justified, given the availability of newer fourth-generation immunoassay tests.Using a dynamic HIV transmission model instantiated with U.S. epidemiologic, demographic, and behavioral data, I estimated the number of acute infections identified, HIV infections prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies. I varied the target population (everyone aged 15-64, injection drug users [IDUs] and men who have sex with men [MSM], or MSM only), screening frequency (annually, or every six months), and test(s) utilized (fourth-generation immunoassay only, or immunoassay followed by pooled NAAT).Annual immunoassay testing of MSM reduces incidence by 9.5\% and costs <$10,000 per QALY gained. Adding pooled NAAT identifies 410 AHI per year, prevents 9.6\% of new cases, costs $92,000 per QALY gained, and remains <$100,000 per QALY gained in settings where undiagnosed HIV prevalence exceeds 4\%. Screening IDUs and MSM annually with fourth-generation immunoassay reduces incidence by 13\% with cost-effectiveness <$10,000 per QALY gained. Increasing the screening frequency to every six months reduces incidence by 11\% (MSM only) or 16\% (MSM and IDUs) and costs <$20,000 per QALY gained.Pooled NAAT testing every 12 months of MSM and IDUs in the United States prevents a modest number of infections, but may be cost-effective given sufficiently high HIV prevalence levels. However, testing via fourth-generation immunoassay every six months prevents a greater number of infections, is more economically efficient, and may obviate the benefits of acute HIV screening via NAAT.},

They play significant roles in constitutive pre-mRNA splicing and are also important regulators of alternative splicing. In addition they participate in post-splicing activities, such as mRNA nuclear export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and mRNA translation. These wide-ranging roles of SR proteins highlight their importance as pivotal regulators of mRNA metabolism, and if these functions are disrupted, developmental defects or disease may result. Furthermore, animal models have shown a highly specific, non-redundant role for individual SR proteins in the regulation of developmental processes. Here, we will review the current literature to demonstrate how SR proteins are emerging as one of the master regulators of gene expression.},

The DNA sequences encoding the complete HIV-1 envelope protein were PCR amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic relationships among the 21 sequences from this study and the 32 previously published full-length env HIV-1 sequences were determined. Twenty of the newly sequenced African isolates could be assigned to envelope subtypes A, C, D, and G. One isolate, collected in Zambia, did not belong to any of the eight previously described subtypes and may represent a prototype sequence of its envelope subtype. The phylogenetic classification of these isolates was strongly supported by bootstrapping and the congruence of trees generated by either distance methods or maximum parsimony analysis. The data presented in this study confirm the existence of several genetic subtypes within the global HIV epidemic and broaden the genetic variability previously observed for envelope subtypes. The geographic spread of different subtypes was shown to be substantial, and the notion of cocirculation of subtypes was reinforced.},

The seven genotypes were evident by both distance matrix methods and maximum parsimony analysis, and were strongly supported by bootstrap resampling of the data. The intra-genotypic gag distances averaged 7\%, whereas the inter-genotypic distances averaged 14\%. The geographic distribution of variants was complex. Some genotypes have apparently migrated to several continents and many areas harbor a mixture of genotypes. Related variants may cluster in certain areas, particularly isolates from a single city collected over a short time.The genetic variation among HIV-1 isolates is more extensive than previously appreciated. At least seven distinct HIV-1 genotypes can be identified. Diversification, migration and establishment of local, temporal 'blooms' of particular variants may all occur concomitantly.},

In contrast, using a high-content model for disrupting pre-existing intramolecular structure in the HIV-1 RNA, as achievable using high-resolution SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) chemical probing information, we discovered strong correlations between inhibition of HIV-1 production in a quantitative cell-based assay and very simple thermodynamic features in the target RNA. Strongest inhibition occurs at RNA target sites that both have an accessible "seed region" and, unexpectedly, are structurally accessible in a newly identified downstream flanking sequence. We then used these simple rules to create a new set of shRNAs and achieved inhibition of HIV-1 production of 90\% or greater for up to 82\% of designed shRNAs. These shRNAs inhibit HIV-1 replication in therapy-relevant T cells and show no or low cytotoxicity. The remarkable success of this straightforward SHAPE-based approach emphasizes that RNAi is governed, in significant part, by very simple, predictable rules reflecting the underlying RNA structure and illustrates principles likely to prove broadly useful in understanding transcriptome-scale biological recognition and therapeutics involving RNA.},

  Abstract                 = {Diversity measurement is important for understanding community structure and dynamics, but has been particularly challenging for microorganisms. Microbial community characterization using small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing datasets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, α-diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and β-diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring α- and β-diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microorganisms in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.},

The gp41 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope plays a major role in this process, but the structure of gp41 is unknown. We have identified a stable, proteinase-resistant structure comprising two peptides, N-51 and C-43, derived from a recombinant protein fragment of the gp41 ectodomain. In isolation, N-51 is predominantly aggregated and C-43 is unfolded. When mixed, however, these peptides associate to form a stable, alpha-helical, discrete trimer of heterodimers. Proteolysis experiments indicate that the relative orientation of the N-51 and C-43 helices in the complex is antiparallel. We propose that N-51 forms an interior, parallel, homotrimeric, coiled-coil core, against which three C-43 helices pack in an antiparallel fashion. We suggest that this alpha-helical, trimeric complex is the core of the fusion-competent state of the HIV-1 envelope.},

However, researchers still face several challenges when using GO and other functional annotation databases. One problem is the large number of multiple hypotheses that are being tested for each study. In addition, categories often overlap with both direct parents/descendents and other distant categories in the hierarchical structure. This makes it hard to determine if the identified significant categories represent different functional outcomes or rather a redundant view of the same biological processes. To overcome these problems we developed a generative probabilistic model which identifies a (small) subset of categories that, together, explain the selected gene set. Our model accommodates noise and errors in the selected gene set and GO. Using controlled GO data our method correctly recovered most of the selected categories, leading to dramatic improvements over current methods for GO analysis. When used with microarray expression data and ChIP-chip data from yeast and human our method was able to correctly identify both general and specific enriched categories which were overlooked by other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been growing evidence for extensive diversity of alternative splicing in human populations. Genetic variants within the 5' splice site can cause splicing differences among human individuals and constitute an important class of human disease mutations. In this study, we explored whether natural variations of splicing could reveal important signals of 5' splice site recognition. In seven lymphoblastoid cell lines of Asian, European and African ancestry, we identified 1174 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the consensus 5' splice site. We selected 129 SNPs predicted to significantly alter the splice site activity, and quantitatively examined their splicing impact in the seven individuals. Surprisingly, outside of the essential GT dinucleotide position, only ∼14\% of the tested SNPs altered splicing. Bioinformatic and minigene analyses identified signals that could modify the impact of 5' splice site polymorphisms, most notably a strong 3' splice site and the presence of intronic motifs downstream of the 5' splice site. Strikingly, we found that the poly-G run, a known intronic splicing enhancer, was the most significantly enriched motif downstream of exons unaffected by 5' splice site SNPs. In TRIM62, the upstream 3' splice site and downstream intronic poly-G runs functioned redundantly to protect an exon from its 5' splice site polymorphism. Collectively, our study reveals widespread context-dependent robustness to 5' splice site polymorphisms in human transcriptomes. Consequently, certain exons are more susceptible to 5' splice site mutations. Additionally, our work demonstrates that genetic diversity of alternative splicing can provide significant insights into the splicing code of mammalian cells.},

Thus there is a growing need to develop technologies that enable rapid characterization of structural features within complex RNA populations. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {While viruses have long been shown to capitalize on their limited genomic size by utilizing both strands of DNA or complementary DNA/RNA intermediates to code for viral proteins, it has been assumed that human retroviruses have all their major proteins translated only from the plus or sense strand of RNA, despite their requirement for a dsDNA proviral intermediate. Several studies, however, have suggested the presence of antisense transcription for both HIV-1 and HTLV-1. More recently an antisense transcript responsible for the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) protein has been described. In this study we investigated the possibility of an antisense gene contained within the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR).Inspection of published sequences revealed a potential transcription initiator element (INR) situated downstream of, and in reverse orientation to, the usual HIV-1 promoter and transcription start site. This antisense initiator (HIVaINR) suggested the possibility of an antisense gene responsible for RNA and protein production. We show that antisense transcripts are generated, in vitro and in vivo, originating from the TAR DNA of the HIV-1 LTR. To test the possibility that protein(s) could be translated from this novel HIV-1 antisense RNA, recombinant HIV antisense gene-FLAG vectors were designed. Recombinant protein(s) were produced and isolated utilizing carboxy-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) sequences. In addition, affinity-purified antisera to an internal peptide derived from the HIV antisense protein (HAP) sequences identified HAPs from HIV+ human peripheral blood lymphocytes.HIV-1 contains an antisense gene in the U3-R regions of the LTR responsible for both an antisense RNA transcript and proteins. This antisense transcript has tremendous potential for intrinsic RNA regulation because of its overlap with the beginning of all HIV-1 sense RNA transcripts by 25 nucleotides. The novel HAPs are encoded in a region of the LTR that has already been shown to be deleted in some HIV-infected long-term survivors and represent new potential targets for vaccine development.},

However, because the observation period of all transfusion-infected persons may be short compared with the average incubation period for AIDS, many cases with long incubation periods have not yet been diagnosed. Thus, the simple average of 2.6 years tends to underestimate the true mean. To correct for this underestimation bias, we assumed that the underlying distribution of the incubation periods is a member of a broad class of probability densities. Then, by maximum likelihood techniques, the mean incubation period for transfusion-associated AIDS was estimated to be 4.5 years, with the 90\% confidence interval ranging from 2.6 to 14.2 years. The long incubation period has important consequences for infected individuals and implications for public health intervention and prevention policy.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of reverse transcriptase to make template switches during DNA synthesis is implicit in models of retrovirus genome replication, as well as in recombination and oncogene transduction. In order to understand such switching, we used in vitro reactions with purified nucleic acids and enzymes. The assay system involved the use of an end-labeled DNA primer so as to allow the quantitation of elongation on a donor template relative to the amount of elongation achieved by template switching (by means of sequence homology) when an acceptor template RNA was added. We examined several variables that affected the efficiency of the reaction: (i) the reaction time, (ii) the relative amounts of acceptor and donor template, (iii) the extent of sequence overlap between the donor and acceptor templates, and (iv) the presence or absence of RNase H activity associated with the reverse transcriptase. The basic reaction, with RNA templates and normal reverse transcriptase, yielded as much as 83\% template switching. In the absence of RNase H, switching still occurred but the efficiency was lowered. Also, when the donor template was changed from RNA to DNA, there was still switching; not surprisingly, this was largely unaffected by the presence or absence of RNase H. Finally, we examined the action of the RNase H on RNA templates after primary transcription but prior to template switching. We found that in most cases, both ends of the original RNA template were able to maintain an association with the DNA product. This result was consistent with the work of others who have shown that RNase H acts as an endonuclease.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear bodies (NBs), characterized by the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, are important components of the nuclear architecture, contributing to genetic and epigenetic control of gene expression. In investigating the mechanisms mediating HIV-1 latency, we determined that silenced but transcriptionally competent HIV-1 proviruses reside in close proximity to PML NBs and that this association inhibits HIV-1 gene expression. PML binds to the latent HIV-1 promoter, which coincides with transcriptionally inactive facultative heterochromatic marks, notably H3K9me2, at the viral genome. PML degradation and NB disruption result in strong activation of viral transcription as well as release of G9a, the major methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and loss of facultative heterochromatin marks from the proviral DNA. Additionally, HIV-1 transcriptional activation requires proviral displacement from PML NBs by active nuclear actin polymerization. Thus, nuclear topology and active gene movement mediate HIV-1 transcriptional regulation and have implications for controlling HIV-1 latency and eradication.},

Virulence was characterized by the decline slope of the CD4 cell count (n = 817 patients), the decline slope of the CD4:CD8 ratio (n = 815 patients) and the viral setpoint (n = 549 patients) in untreated patients with sufficient data points. Linear regression models were used to detect correlations between the date of diagnosis (ranging between 1984 and 2003) and the virulence markers, controlling for gender, exposure category, age and CD4 cell count at entry.We found no correlation between any of the virulence markers and the date of diagnosis. Inspection of short-term trends confirmed that virulence has fluctuated around a stable level over time.The lack of long-term time trends in the virulence markers indicates that HIV-1 is not evolving towards increasing or decreasing virulence at a perceptible rate. Both highly virulent and attenuated strains have apparently been unable to spread at the population level. This result suggests that either the evolution of virulence may be slow or inhibited due to evolutionary constraints, or HIV-1 may have already evolved to optimal virulence in the human host.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent origin and great evolutionary potential of HIV imply that the virulence of the virus might still be changing, which could greatly affect the future of the pandemic. However, previous studies of time trends of HIV virulence have yielded conflicting results. Here we used an established methodology to assess time trends in the severity (virulence) of untreated HIV infections in a large Italian cohort. We characterized clinical virulence by the decline slope of the CD4 count (n = 1423 patients) and the viral setpoint (n = 785 patients) in untreated patients with sufficient data points. We used linear regression models to detect correlations between the date of diagnosis (ranging 1984-2006) and the virulence markers, controlling for gender, exposure category, age, and CD4 count at entry. The decline slope of the CD4 count and the viral setpoint displayed highly significant correlation with the date of diagnosis pointing in the direction of increasing virulence. A detailed analysis of riskgroups revealed that the epidemics of intravenous drug users started with an apparently less virulent virus, but experienced the strongest trend towards steeper CD4 decline among the major exposure categories. While our study did not allow us to exclude the effect of potential time trends in host factors, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing HIV virulence. Importantly, the use of an established methodology allowed for a comparison with earlier results, which confirmed that genuine differences exist in the time trends of HIV virulence between different epidemics. We thus conclude that there is not a single global trend of HIV virulence, and results obtained in one epidemic cannot be extrapolated to others. Comparison of discordant patterns between riskgroups and epidemics hints at a converging trend, which might indicate that an optimal level of virulence might exist for the virus.},

  Abstract                 = {In analysis of bioinformatics data, a unique challenge arises from the high dimensionality of measurements. Without loss of generality, we use genomic study with gene expression measurements as a representative example but note that analysis techniques discussed in this article are also applicable to other types of bioinformatics studies. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classic dimension reduction approach. It constructs linear combinations of gene expressions, called principal components (PCs). The PCs are orthogonal to each other, can effectively explain variation of gene expressions, and may have a much lower dimensionality. PCA is computationally simple and can be realized using many existing software packages. This article consists of the following parts. First, we review the standard PCA technique and their applications in bioinformatics data analysis. Second, we describe recent 'non-standard' applications of PCA, including accommodating interactions among genes, pathways and network modules and conducting PCA with estimating equations as opposed to gene expressions. Third, we introduce several recently proposed PCA-based techniques, including the supervised PCA, sparse PCA and functional PCA. The supervised PCA and sparse PCA have been shown to have better empirical performance than the standard PCA. The functional PCA can analyze time-course gene expression data. Last, we raise the awareness of several critical but unsolved problems related to PCA. The goal of this article is to make bioinformatics researchers aware of the PCA technique and more importantly its most recent development, so that this simple yet effective dimension reduction technique can be better employed in bioinformatics data analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are the remnants of ancient germ cell infection by exogenous retroviruses and occupy up to 8\% of the human genome. It has been suggested that HERV sequences have contributed to primate evolution by regulating the expression of cellular genes and mediating chromosome rearrangements. After integration approximately 28 million years ago, members of the HERV-K (HML-2) family have continued to amplify and recombine. To investigate the utility of HML-2 polymorphisms as markers for the study of more recent human evolution, we compiled a list of the structure and integration sites of sequences that are unique to humans and screened each insertion for polymorphism within the human genome databases. Of the total of 74 HML-2 sequences, 18 corresponded to complete or near-complete proviruses, 49 were solitary long terminal repeats (LTRs), 6 were incomplete LTRs, and 1 was a SVA retrotransposon. A number of different allelic configurations were identified including the alternation of a provirus and solitary LTR. We developed polymerase chain reaction-based assays for seven HML-2 loci and screened 109 human DNA samples from Africa, Europe, Asia, and Southeast Asia. Our results indicate that the diversity of HML-2 elements is higher in African than non-African populations, with population differentiation values ranging from 0.6 to 9.8\%. These findings denote a recent expansion from Africa. We compare the phylogenetic relationships of HML-2 sequences that are unique to humans and consider whether these elements have played a role in the remodeling of the hominid genome.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV integration within host cell genomic DNA is a requisite step of the viral infection cycle. Yet, characteristics of the sites of provirus integration within the host genome remain obscure. The authors present evidence that in diseased tissues showing a high level of HIV DNA and macrophage-associated HIV p24 antigen expression from end stage forms of HIV disease, HIV-1 integration sites were favored within genes and transcriptionally active host cell genomic loci. Using an inverse PCR (IPCR) technique that identified dominant integrated forms of HIV, clonal IPCR products were isolated from AIDS dementia, AIDS lymphoma, and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy tissues. Thirty of 34 disease-associated HIV-1 insertions were identified within annotated and hypothetical genes, an unexpected but highly nonrandom genetic coding region association (p <.026). The 1\% sensitivity thresholds used for HIV IPCR suggested some form of selective expansion of cells containing these HIV proviruses. Consistent with this interpretation were the HIV-1 insertion sites identified within introns of genes that encoded for factors associated with signal transduction, apoptosis, and transcription regulation. In addition, HIV-1 proviruses were frequently found proximal to genes that encoded for receptor-associated, signal transduction-associated, transcription-associated, and translation-associated proteins. HIV-1 integration within host cell genomic DNA potentially represents a significant insertional mutagenic event. In certain cases, provirus insertions may mediate the dysregulation of specific gene expression events, providing mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis associated with certain AIDS-related diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {The isolation of clones encoding the human surface protein T4, and the expression of the T4 gene in new cellular environments, have enabled us to examine the role of this protein in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Our studies support a mechanism of AIDS virus infection that initially involves the specific interaction of the AIDS virus with T4 molecules on the cell surface. This association can be demonstrated on T4+ transformed T and B lymphocytes as well as epithelial cells. Furthermore, the presence of T4 on the surface of all human cells examined is sufficient to render these cells susceptible to AIDS virus infection. Our data suggest that the T4-AIDS virus complex is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Finally, we find that the T4 gene is expressed in the brain as well as in lymphoid cells, providing an explanation for the dual neurotropic and lymphotropic character of the AIDS virus. In this manner, a T lymphocyte surface protein important in mediating effector cell-target cell interactions has been exploited by a human retrovirus to specifically target the AIDS virus to populations of T4+ cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Inefficient alternative splicing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) primary RNA transcript results in greater than half of all viral mRNA remaining unspliced. Regulation of HIV-1 alternative splicing occurs through the presence of suboptimal viral 5' and 3' splice sites (5' and 3'ss), which are positively regulated by exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) and negatively regulated by exonic splicing silencers (ESS) and intronic splicing silencers (ISS). We previously showed that splicing at HIV-1 3'ss A2 is repressed by ESSV and enhanced by the downstream 5'ss D3 signal. Disruption of ESSV results in increased vpr mRNA accumulation and exon 3 inclusion, decreased accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA, and decreased virus production.Here we show that optimization of the 5'ss D2 signal results in increased splicing at the upstream 3'ss A1, increased inclusion of exon 2 into viral mRNA, decreased accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA, and decreased virus production. Virus production from the 5'ss D2 and ESSV mutants was rescued by transient expression of HIV-1 Gag and Pol. We further show that the increased inclusion of either exon 2 or 3 does not significantly affect the stability of viral mRNA but does result in an increase and decrease, respectively, in HIV-1 mRNA levels. The changes in viral mRNA levels directly correlate with changes in tat mRNA levels observed upon increased inclusion of exon 2 or 3.These results demonstrate that splicing at HIV-1 3'ss A1 is regulated by the strength of the downstream 5'ss signal and that suboptimal splicing at 3'ss A1 is necessary for virus replication. Furthermore, the replication defective phenotype resulting from increased splicing at 3'ss A1 is similar to the phenotype observed upon increased splicing at 3'ss A2. Further examination of the role of 5'ss D2 and D3 in the alternative splicing of 3'ss A1 and A2, respectively, is necessary to delineate a role for non-coding exon inclusion in HIV-1 replication.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomic mRNA produces more than 40 unique viral mRNA species, of which more than half remain incompletely spliced within an HIV-1-infected cell. Regulation of splicing at HIV-1 3' splice sites (3'ss) requires suboptimal polypyrimidine tracts, and positive or negative regulation of splicing occurs through binding of cellular factors to cis-acting splicing regulatory elements. We have previously shown that splicing at HIV-1 3'ss A2, which produces vpr mRNA and promotes inclusion of HIV-1 exon 3, is repressed by the hnRNP A/B-dependent exonic splicing silencer ESSV. Here we show that ESSV activity downstream of 3'ss A2 is localized to a 16-nucleotide element within HIV-1 exon 3. HIV-1 replication was reduced by 95\% when ESSV was inactivated by mutagenesis. Reduced replication was concomitant with increased inclusion of exon 3 within spliced viral mRNA and decreased accumulation of unspliced viral mRNA, resulting in decreased cell-associated p55 Gag. Prolonged culture of ESSV mutant viruses resulted in two independent second-site reversions disrupting the splice sites that define exon 3, 3'ss A2 and 5' splice site D3. Either of these changes restored both HIV-1 replication and regulated viral splicing. Therefore, inhibition of HIV-1 3'ss A2 splicing is necessary for HIV-1 replication.},

  Abstract                 = {To establish productive infection, a retrovirus must insert a DNA replica of its genome into host cell chromosomal DNA. This process is operated by the intasome, a nucleoprotein complex composed of an integrase tetramer (IN) assembled on the viral DNA ends. The intasome engages chromosomal DNA within a target capture complex to carry out strand transfer, irreversibly joining the viral and cellular DNA molecules. Although several intasome/transpososome structures from the DDE(D) recombinase superfamily have been reported, the mechanics of target DNA capture and strand transfer by these enzymes remained unclear. Here we report crystal structures of the intasome from prototype foamy virus in complex with target DNA, elucidating the pre-integration target DNA capture and post-catalytic strand transfer intermediates of the retroviral integration process. The cleft between IN dimers within the intasome accommodates chromosomal DNA in a severely bent conformation, allowing widely spaced IN active sites to access the scissile phosphodiester bonds. Our results resolve the structural basis for retroviral DNA integration and provide a framework for the design of INs with altered target sequences.},

Since splicing is an essential point of control during HIV gene expression, we carried out additional experiments to examine SC35 expression during HIV infection. RNA blots confirmed that SC35 RNA was induced following HIV infection; a 2-3-fold increase in expression of SC35 RNA was detected by day 2 of HIV infection. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting revealed concomitant increases in SC35 protein and double staining studies demonstrated that increases in SC35 protein occurred specifically in the HIV-infected cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed SC35 was associated with 2 microm 'nuclear speckles' in both infected and uninfected cells, suggesting that increases in SC35 accumulated in these nuclear structures and that HIV infection did not alter the intracellular distribution of SC35. These findings indicate that an essential splicing factor is induced after HIV infection, suggesting that the consequences of HIV infection include alterations in relative levels of a splicing factor.},

The Rev protein acts posttranscriptionally to induce the sequence-specific nuclear export of unspliced HIV-1 mRNA species that are otherwise excluded from the cell cytoplasm. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify two distinct regions of the HIV-1 Rev protein that are required for in vivo biological activity. The larger and more N-terminal of these two regions includes, but extends beyond, an arginine-rich sequence element required for nuclear localization. Mutation of a second, more C-terminal Rev protein sequence element was found to yield defective Rev proteins that act as trans-dominant inhibitors of Rev function. These Rev mutants are shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication when expressed in transfected cells and may have potential application in the treatment of HIV-1 related disease.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the features of primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs and SIVs) that distinguishes them from other retroviruses is the array of "accessory" proteins they encode. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding the interactions of the HIV-1 Nef, Vif, Vpu, and Vpr proteins with factors and pathways expressed in cells of the immune system. In at least three instances, the principal activity of the accessory proteins appears to be evasion from various forms of cell-mediated (or intrinsic), antiviral resistance. Broadly speaking, the HIV-1 accessory proteins modify the local environment within infected cells to ensure viral persistence, replication, dissemination, and transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {The pathogenic human retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes two trans-acting nuclear proteins, tat and rev, whose functional expression is essential for viral replication in vitro. The tat protein greatly enhances the expression of both structural and regulatory genes of HIV-1 (linked to the viral long-terminal-repeat promoter element), whereas the rev gene product (previously termed art or trs) has only been shown to be required for the synthesis of structural proteins. Here, we demonstrate that rev also moderates the expression of regulatory genes of HIV-1. It decreases the expression of messenger RNAs that encode the full-length form of the viral tat gene product or the rev protein itself, and induces the synthesis of a previously unreported, truncated tat protein. These actions of rev are mediated by a dramatic shift in the ratio of spliced to unspliced cytoplasmic HIV-1 mRNA. Therefore rev not only activates the synthesis of the viral structural proteins, but also modulates the level and quality of HIV-1 regulatory gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication requires the expression of two classes of viral mRNA. The early class of HIV-1 transcripts is fully spliced and encodes viral regulatory gene products. The functional expression of one of these nuclear regulatory proteins, termed Rev (formerly Art or Trs), induces the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced, late class of HIV-1 mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins, including Gag and Env. Here, we provide evidence that this induction reflects the export from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm of a pool of unspliced viral RNA constitutively expressed in the nucleus. The hypothesis that Rev acts on RNA transport, rather than splicing, is further supported by the observation that the cytoplasmic expression of a non-spliceable HIV-1 env gene sequence is also subject to Rev regulation. Here we show that this Rev response requires a specific target sequence which coincides with a complex RNA secondary structure present in the env gene. The response to Rev is fully maintained when this sequence is relocated to other exonic or intronic locations within env but is ablated by inversion. These results indicate that the HIV-1 rev gene product induces HIV-1 structural gene expression by activating the sequence-specific nuclear export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNA species.},

Ignoring the differences between their efficiencies may lead to miscalculation of gene expression even with the same starting amount of template. Although there are several tools performing PCR primer design, there is no tool available that predicts PCR efficiency for a given amplicon and primer pair. RESULTS: We have used a statistical approach based on 90 primer pair combinations amplifying templates from bacteria, yeast, plants and humans, ranging in size between 74 and 907 bp to identify the parameters that affect PCR efficiency. We developed a generalized additive model fitting the data and constructed an open source Web interface that allows the obtention of oligonucleotides optimized for PCR with predicted amplification efficiencies starting from a given sequence. CONCLUSIONS: pcrEfficiency provides an easy-to-use web interface predicting PCR efficiencies prior to web lab experiments thus easing quantitative real-time PCR set-up.

  Abstract                 = {The expression of ribosomal protein (rp) genes is regulated at multiple levels. In yeast, two genes are autoregulated by feedback effects of the protein on pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we have investigated whether similar mechanisms occur in eukaryotes with more complicated and highly regulated splicing patterns. Comparisons of the sequences of ribosomal protein S13 gene (RPS13) among mammals and birds revealed that intron 1 is more conserved than the other introns. Transfection of HEK 293 cells with a minigene-expressing ribosomal protein S13 showed that the presence of intron 1 reduced expression by a factor of four. Ribosomal protein S13 was found to inhibit excision of intron 1 from rpS13 pre-mRNA fragment in vitro. This protein was shown to be able to specifically bind the fragment and to confer protection against ribonuclease cleavage at sequences near the 5' and 3' splice sites. The results suggest that overproduction of rpS13 in mammalian cells interferes with splicing of its own pre-mRNA by a feedback mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The main adaptive immune response to bacteria is mediated by B cells and CD4+ T-cells. However, some bacterial proteins reach the cytosol of host cells and are exposed to the host CD8+ T-cells response. Both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can translocate proteins to the cytosol through type III and IV secretion and ESX-1 systems, respectively. The translocated proteins are often essential for the bacterium survival. Once injected, these proteins can be degraded and presented on MHC-I molecules to CD8+ T-cells. The CD8+ T-cells, in turn, can induce cell death and destroy the bacteria's habitat. In viruses, escape mutations arise to avoid this detection. The accumulation of escape mutations in bacteria has never been systematically studied. We show for the first time that such mutations are systematically present in most bacteria tested. We combine multiple bioinformatic algorithms to compute CD8+ T-cell epitope libraries of bacteria with secretion systems that translocate proteins to the host cytosol. In all bacteria tested, proteins not translocated to the cytosol show no escape mutations in their CD8+ T-cell epitopes. However, proteins translocated to the cytosol show clear escape mutations and have low epitope densities for most tested HLA alleles. The low epitope densities suggest that bacteria, like viruses, are evolutionarily selected to ensure their survival in the presence of CD8+ T-cells. In contrast with most other translocated proteins examined, Pseudomonas aeruginosa's ExoU, which ultimately induces host cell death, was found to have high epitope density. This finding suggests a novel mechanism for the manipulation of CD8+ T-cells by pathogens. The ExoU effector may have evolved to maintain high epitope density enabling it to efficiently induce CD8+ T-cell mediated cell death. These results were tested using multiple epitope prediction algorithms, and were found to be consistent for most proteins tested.},

  Abstract                 = {The continued global spread and evolution of HIV diversity pose significant challenges to diagnostics and vaccine strategies. NIAID partnered with the FDA, WRAIR, academia, and industry to form a Viral Panel Working Group to design and prepare a panel of well-characterized current and diverse HIV isolates. Plasma samples that had screened positive for HIV infection and had evidence of recently acquired infection were donated by blood centers in North and South America, Europe, and Africa. A total of 80 plasma samples were tested by quantitative nucleic acid tests, p24 antigen, EIA, and Western blot to assign a Fiebig stage indicative of approximate time from initial infection. Evaluation of viral load using FDA-cleared assays showed excellent concordance when subtype B virus was tested, but lower correlations for subtype C. Plasma samples were cocultivated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal donors to generate 30 viral isolates (50-80\% success rate for samples with viral load >10,000 copies/ml), which were then expanded to 10(7)-10(9) virus copies per ml. Analysis of env sequences showed that sequences derived from cultured PBMCs were not distinguishable from those obtained from the original plasma. The pilot collection includes 30 isolates representing subtypes B, C, B/F, CRF04_cpx, and CRF02_AG. These studies will serve as a basis for the development of a comprehensive panel of highly characterized viral isolates that reflects the current dynamic and complex HIV epidemic, and will be made available through the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL).},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 RNA undergoes a complex splicing process whereby over 40 different mRNA species are produced by alternative splicing. In addition, approximately half of the RNA transcripts remain unspliced and either are used to encode Gag and Gag-Pol proteins or are packaged into virions as genomic RNA. It has previously been shown that HIV-1 splicing is regulated by cis elements that bind to cellular factors. These factors either enhance or repress definition of exons that are flanked by the HIV-1 3' splice sites. Here we report that expression of modified U1 snRNPs with increased affinity to HIV-1 downstream 5' splice sites and to sequences within the first tat coding exon act to selectively increase splicing at the upstream 3' splice sites in cotransfected 293T cells. This results in a decrease of unspliced viral RNA levels and an approximately 10-fold decrease in virus production. In addition, excessive splicing of viral RNA is concomitant with a striking reduction in the relative amounts of Gag processing intermediates and products. We also show that T cell lines expressing modified U1 snRNAs exhibit reduced HIV-1 replication. Our results suggest that induction of excessive HIV-1 RNA splicing may be a novel strategy to inhibit virus replication in human patients.},

  Abstract                 = {We have previously described several human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutants that are characterized by an excessive-RNA-splicing phenotype and reduced virus particle production. In one of these mutants (NLD2up), the sequence of 5' splice site D2 was changed to a consensus splice donor site. This splice site overlaps the HIV-1 integrase reading frame, and thus, the NLD2up mutant also bears a G-to-W change at amino acid 247 of the integrase. A previously described E-to-K mutant at position 246 of the C-terminal domain of the integrase, which resulted in a G-to-A mutation at the +3 position of overlapping splice donor D2 (NLD2A3), was also shown to affect virus particle production and Gag protein processing. By using second-site mutations to revert the excessive-splicing phenotype, we show that the effects on Gag protein processing and virus particle production of both the NLD2up and NLD2A3 mutants are caused by excessive viral RNA splicing due to the activation of the overlapping 5' splice site and not to the changes in the integrase protein. Both integrase protein mutations, however, are lethal for virus infectivity. These studies suggest that changes in the usage of overlapping splice sites may be a possible alternative explanation for a defective virus phenotype resulting from changes in protein-coding sequences or in the nucleotide sequence during codon optimization.},

Emerging data indicate that alternate reading frames (ARFs) of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encode CD8+ T cell epitopes, termed cryptic epitopes. Here, we show that SIV-specific CD8+ T cells from SIV-infected rhesus macaques target 14 epitopes in eight ARFs during SIV infection. Animals recognized up to five epitopes, totaling nearly one-quarter of the anti-SIV responses. The epitopes were targeted by high-frequency responses as early as 2 weeks postinfection and in the chronic phase. Hence, previously overlooked ARF-encoded epitopes could be important components of AIDS vaccines.},

  Abstract                 = {Viral replication usually requires that innate intracellular lines of defence be overcome, a task usually accomplished by specialized viral gene products. The virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is required during the late stages of viral production to counter the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G; also known as CEM15), a protein expressed notably in human T lymphocytes. When produced in the presence of APOBEC3G, vif-defective virus is non-infectious. APOBEC3G is closely related to APOBEC1, the central component of an RNA-editing complex that deaminates a cytosine residue in apoB messenger RNA. APOBEC family members also have potent DNA mutator activity through dC deamination; however, whether the editing potential of APOBEC3G has any relevance to HIV inhibition is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that it does, as APOBEC3G exerts its antiviral effect during reverse transcription to trigger G-to-A hypermutation in the nascent retroviral DNA. We also find that APOBEC3G can act on a broad range of retroviruses in addition to HIV, suggesting that hypermutation by editing is a general innate defence mechanism against this important group of pathogens.},

A specific receptor was not detected by protein crosslinking experiments, and uptake was not affected by treating cells with trypsin, heparinase or neuraminidase. Uptake and transactivation could be inhibited by incubation with heparin, dextran sulfate, an anti-Tat monoclonal antibody, or by incubation at 4 degrees C. In contrast, transactivation by Tat was markedly stimulated by the addition of basic peptides, such as Tat 38-58 or protamine. Fluorescence experiments with rhodamine-conjugated Tat show punctate staining on the cell surface and then localization to the cytoplasm and nucleus. The lack of a specific receptor makes it unclear whether Tat uptake is biologically important in HIV infection, however, the efficiency of uptake raises the possibility that Tat may be useful for delivery of protein molecules into cells.},

The forward mutation rate of HIV-1 was found to be 3 x 10(-5) mutations per target base pair per cycle, or about 20-fold lower than the error rates reported for purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with sense-strand RNA and DNA templates of the lacZ alpha peptide gene in a cell-free system. To test the hypothesis that the vpr gene product might, at least in part, account for the lower mutation rate observed in vivo, a HIV-1 vector was replicated to determine if the mutation rate was higher in the absence of the wild-type vpr gene product. A vpr- shuttle vector had an overall mutation rate as much as 4-fold higher than that of the parental vector. A shuttle vector with an amino acid substitution in Vpr that prevents efficient incorporation of Vpr into virus particles was found to have a mutation frequency similar to that of the vpr- vector, and was interpreted to indicate a requirement for Vpr incorporation into the virus particle in order to observe the influence of vpr on the mutation rate. Replication of a vpr- shuttle vector in the presence of a wild-type vpr expression plasmid led to a mutation frequency similar to that of the parental vector, suggesting that the vpr mutation could be complemented in trans. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Vpr virion incorporation coincided with the influence of vpr on the mutation rate.},

The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection.},

DNA sequence analysis of the 4kb cDNA insert (pHE.1) revealed the presence of ORFs potentially coding for putative retrovirus-related gag, pol and env proteins. Northern blot and RNase protection experiments showed that RNA homologous to the pHE.1 insert is detected only in embryonal carcinoma cells as a 8 kb mRNA, and its expression is negatively regulated during retinoic acid induced differentiation of the human teratocarcinoma cell line NT2/D1. Using a pol specific probe we have isolated a genomic locus containing the ERV-9 sequences. Characterization by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing allowed us to define LTR-like sequences, that are composed by a complex array of subrepetitive elements. In addition we show that ERV-9 LTR sequences are capable to drive expression of linked CAT gene in a cell specific manner as LTR promoter activity has been detected only in NT2/D1 cells.},

  Abstract                 = {The Tat protein of HIV-1 trans-activates transcription in vitro in a cell-free extract of HeLa nuclei. Quantitative analysis of the efficiency of elongation revealed that a majority of the elongation complexes generated by the HIV-1 promoter were not highly processive and terminated within the first 500 nucleotides. Tat trans-activation of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter resulted from an increase in processive character of the elongation complexes. More specifically, the analysis suggests that there exist two classes of elongation complexes initiating from the HIV promoter: a less-processive form and a more-processive form. Addition of purified Tat protein was found to increase the abundance of the more-processive class of elongation complex. The purine nucleoside analog, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibits transcription in this reaction by decreasing the efficiency of elongation. Surprisingly, stimulation of transcription elongation by Tat was preferentially inhibited by the addition of DRB.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The full complement of DNA mutations that are responsible for the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not yet known. Methods We used massively parallel DNA sequencing to obtain a very high level of coverage (approximately 98%) of a primary, cytogenetically normal, de novo genome for AML with minimal maturation (AML-M1) and a matched normal skin genome. Results We identified 12 acquired (somatic) mutations within the coding sequences of genes and 52 somatic point mutations in conserved or regulatory portions of the genome. All mutations appeared to be heterozygous and present in nearly all cells in the tumor sample. Four of the 64 mutations occurred in at least 1 additional AML sample in 188 samples that were tested. Mutations in NRAS and NPM1 had been identified previously in patients with AML, but two other mutations had not been identified. One of these mutations, in the IDH1 gene, was present in 15 of 187 additional AML genomes tested and was strongly associated with normal cytogenetic status; it was present in 13 of 80 cytogenetically normal samples (16%). The other was a nongenic mutation in a genomic region with regulatory potential and conservation in higher mammals; we detected it in one additional AML tumor. The AML genome that we sequenced contains approximately 750 point mutations, of which only a small fraction are likely to be relevant to pathogenesis. Conclusions By comparing the sequences of tumor and skin genomes of a patient with AML-M1, we have identified recurring mutations that may be relevant for pathogenesis.},

Microtubules are tubulin polymers that are essential for cell structure and division. Molecules that target microtubules induce apoptosis and are potent anti-cancer drugs. We studied the effect on tubulin polymerization of three Tat variants: Tat HxB2 and Tat Eli from patients who are rapid progressors (RP) and Tat Oyi from highly exposed but persistently seronegative (HEPS) patients. We compared the effect on tubulin polymerization of these Tat variants and peptides corresponding to different parts of the Tat sequence, with paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug that targets microtubules.We show that Tat, and specifically, residues 38-72, directly enhance tubulin polymerization. We demonstrate that Tat could also directly trigger the mitochondrial pathway to induce T cell apoptosis, as shown in vitro by the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria.These results show that Tat directly acts on microtubule polymerization and provide insights into the mechanism of T cell apoptosis mediated by extra-cellular Tat.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif (virion infectivity factor) is required for the production of infectious virions by CD4(+) lymphocytes. Vif facilitates particle infectivity by blocking the inhibitory activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a virion-encapsidated cellular protein that deaminates minus-strand reverse transcript cytosines to uracils. We report that HIV-1 Vif forms a complex with human APOBEC3G that prevents its virion encapsidation. HIV-1 Vif did not efficiently form a complex with mouse APOBEC3G. Vif dramatically reduced the amount of human APOBEC3G encapsidated in HIV-1 virions but did not prevent encapsidation of mouse or AGM APOBEC3G. As a result, these enzymes are potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV-1 replication. The species-specificity of this interaction may play a role in restricting HIV-1 infection to humans. Together these findings suggest that therapeutic intervention that either induced APOBEC3G or blocked its interaction with Vif could be clinically beneficial.},

In the absence of Vif, this antiviral pathway efficiently inactivates HIV-1. It was recently reported that APOBEC3G (also known as CEM-15), a cytidine deaminase nucleic acid-editing enzyme, confers this antiviral phenotype on permissive cells. Here we describe evidence that Vif binds APOBEC3G and induces its rapid degradation, thus eliminating it from cells and preventing its incorporation into HIV-1 virions. Studies of Vif mutants imply that it contains two domains, one that binds APOBEC3G and another with a conserved SLQ(Y/F)LA motif that mediates APOBEC3G degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway. These results provide promising approaches for drug discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-standing evidence indicates that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) preferentially integrates into a subset of transcriptionally active genes of the host cell genome. However, the reason why the virus selects only certain genes among all transcriptionally active regions in a target cell remains largely unknown. Here we show that HIV-1 integration occurs in the outer shell of the nucleus in close correspondence with the nuclear pore. This region contains a series of cellular genes, which are preferentially targeted by the virus, and characterized by the presence of active transcription chromatin marks before viral infection. In contrast, the virus strongly disfavours the heterochromatic regions in the nuclear lamin-associated domains and other transcriptionally active regions located centrally in the nucleus. Functional viral integrase and the presence of the cellular Nup153 and LEDGF/p75 integration cofactors are indispensable for the peripheral integration of the virus. Once integrated at the nuclear pore, the HIV-1 DNA makes contact with various nucleoporins; this association takes part in the transcriptional regulation of the viral genome. These results indicate that nuclear topography is an essential determinant of the HIV-1 life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

  Abstract                 = {CD4 is the principal receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We have isolated and studied CD4-expressing tumor cell clones made by expressing CD4 in the T-cell tumor line HSB. Two clones, one designated HSBCD4, a clone expressing low levels of CD4, and the other, HSB10xCD4, a high-expresser CD4+ clone, were studied for their ability to bind and replicate HIV. In contrast to many other CD4+ cells that down-modulate CD4 following HIV infection, the HSB10xCD4 clones continued to express high levels of surface CD4 following infection with HIV. Unlike infection of HSBCD4 or many other human CD4+ cells, HIV infection of HSB10xCD4 clone was short lived: p24 antigen, provirus, or coculturable virus was present for less than 14 days following infection with several strains of HIV-1 or with HIV-2. When infection was initiated by transfection of proviral DNA, high and low CD4 expressers initially produced p24 antigen at approximately the same level. However, high CD4 expressers produced coculturable virus only during the first few days following transfection, whereas low CD4 expressers transfected with HIV continued to produce virus beyond 6 weeks. Monoclonal antibody-mediated down-modulation of CD4 surface expression on HSB10xCD4 clones permitted these formerly HIV-resistant cells to become persistently infected with HIV. Thus, high concentrations of CD4 on the surface of an HIV-infected cell prevent persistent HIV infection of CD4+ cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of human genetic variation and a resource for mapping complex genetic traits1. The large volume of data produced by high-throughput sequencing projects is a rich and largely untapped source of SNPs (refs 2, 3, 4, 5). We present here a unified approach to the discovery of variations in genetic sequence data of arbitrary DNA sources. We propose to use the rapidly emerging genomic sequence6, 7 as a template on which to layer often unmapped, fragmentary sequence data8, 9, 10, 11 and to use base quality values12 to discern true allelic variations from sequencing errors. By taking advantage of the genomic sequence we are able to use simpler yet more accurate methods for sequence organization: fragment clustering, paralogue identification and multiple alignment. We analyse these sequences with a novel, Bayesian inference engine, POLYBAYES, to calculate the probability that a given site is polymorphic. Rigorous treatment of base quality permits completely automated evaluation of the full length of all sequences, without limitations on alignment depth. We demonstrate this approach by accurate SNP predictions in human ESTs aligned to finished and working-draft quality genomic sequences, a data set representative of the typical challenges of sequence-based SNP discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {The formation and execution of a productive immune response requires the maturation of competent T cells and a robust change in cellular activity upon antigen challenge. Such changes in cellular function depend on regulated alterations to protein expression. Previous research has focused on defining transcriptional changes that regulate protein expression during T-cell maturation and antigen stimulation. Here, we globally analyze another critical process in gene regulation during T-cell stimulation, alternative splicing. Specifically, we use RNA-seq profiling to identify 178 exons in 168 genes that exhibit robust changes in inclusion in response to stimulation of a human T-cell line. Supporting an important role for the global coordination of alternative splicing following T-cell stimulation, these signal-responsive exons are significantly enriched in genes with functional annotations specifically related to immune response. The vast majority of these genes also exhibit differential alternative splicing between naive and activated primary T cells. Comparison of the responsiveness of splicing to various stimuli in the cultured and primary T cells further reveals at least three distinct networks of signal-induced alternative splicing events. Importantly, we find that each regulatory network is specifically associated with distinct sequence features, suggesting that they are controlled by independent regulatory mechanisms. These results thus provide a basis for elucidating mechanisms of signal pathway-specific regulation of alternative splicing during T-cell stimulation.},

HIV-1-infected women and their infants exposed to sdNVP in 2 consecutive pregnancies-used alone or with zidovudine (ZDV) or ZDV plus lamivudine-were included.The median age of women at their initial exposure to sdNVP in Soweto (n = 120) and Abidjan (n = 41) was 26 (interquartile range [IQR]: 22-29) years and 28 (IQR: 24-31) years, respectively, and their median delivery interval was 21 (IQR: 15-29) months and 26 (IQR: 20-32) months, respectively. Transmission rates in Soweto and in Abidjan were 11.1\% and 13.2\% for the first pregnancy and 11.1\% and 5.4\% for the second pregnancy (P = 1.000 and P = 0.449 for Soweto and Abidjan, respectively, in unpaired analysis).This analysis suggests that the effectiveness of sdNVP when used in successive pregnancies is probably not impaired, possibly because viral resistance selected by prior exposure to sdNVP may wane with time.},

In the remaining three, no diagnosis of an immunosuppressive disease was established, despite persistence of immune defects. These cases of pneumocystosis suggest the importance of cell-mediated immune function in the defense against P. carinii.

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing accounts for much of the complexity in higher eukaryotes. Thus, its regulation must allow for flexibility without hampering either its specificity or its fidelity. The mechanisms involved in alternative splicing regulation, especially those acting through coupling with transcription, have not been deeply studied in in vivo models. Much of our knowledge comes from in vitro approaches, where conditions can be precisely controlled at the expense of losing several levels of regulation present in intact cells. Here we studied the relative order of removal of the introns flanking a model alternative cassette exon. We show that there is a preferential removal of the intron downstream from the cassette exon before the upstream intron has been removed. Most importantly, both cis-acting mutations and trans-acting factors that regulate the model alternative splicing event differentially affect the relative order of removal. However, reduction of transcriptional elongation causing higher inclusion of the cassette exon does not change the order of intron removal, suggesting that the assumption, according to the "first come, first served" model, that slow elongation promotes preferential excision of the upstream intron has to be revised. We propose instead that slow elongation favors commitment to exon inclusion during spliceosome assembly. Our results reveal that measuring the order of intron removal may be a straightforward read-out to discriminate among different mechanisms of alternative splice site selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Cytoskeletal components play a major role in the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. A wide variety of molecules belonging to the microfilament system, including actin filaments and actin binding proteins, as well as microtubules have a key role in regulating both cell life and death. Cell shape maintenance, cell polarity and cell movements as well as cytoplasmic trafficking of molecules determining cell fate, including apoptosis, are in fact instructed by the cytoskeleton components. HIV infection and viral particle production seem to be controlled by cytoskeleton as well. Furthermore, HIV-associated apoptosis failure can also be regulated by the actin network function. In fact, HIV protein gp120 is able to induce cytoskeleton-driven polarization, thus sensitizing T cells to CD95/Fas-mediated apoptosis. The microfilament system seems thus to be a sort of cytoplasmic supervisor of the viral particle, the host cell and the bystander cell's very fate.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular (nucleic acid)-based diagnostics tests have many advantages over immunoassays, particularly with regard to sensitivity and specificity. Most on-site diagnostic tests, however, are immunoassay-based because conventional nucleic acid-based tests (NATs) require extensive sample processing, trained operators, and specialized equipment. To make NATs more convenient, especially for point-of-care diagnostics and on-site testing, a simple plastic microfluidic cassette ("chip") has been developed for nucleic acid-based testing of blood, other clinical specimens, food, water, and environmental samples. The chip combines nucleic acid isolation by solid-phase extraction; isothermal enzymatic amplification such as LAMP (Loop-mediated AMPlification), NASBA (Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification), and RPA (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification); and real-time optical detection of DNA or RNA analytes. The microfluidic cassette incorporates an embedded nucleic acid binding membrane in the amplification reaction chamber. Target nucleic acids extracted from a lysate are captured on the membrane and amplified at a constant incubation temperature. The amplification product, labeled with a fluorophore reporter, is excited with a LED light source and monitored in situ in real time with a photodiode or a CCD detector (such as available in a smartphone). For blood analysis, a companion filtration device that separates plasma from whole blood to provide cell-free samples for virus and bacterial lysis and nucleic acid testing in the microfluidic chip has also been developed. For HIV virus detection in blood, the microfluidic NAT chip achieves a sensitivity and specificity that are nearly comparable to conventional benchtop protocols using spin columns and thermal cyclers.},

Despite substantial prior work, there is still a pressing need for efficient and effective methods of detecting recombination and analyzing recombinant sequences. RESULTS: We introduce Recco, a novel fast method that, given a multiple sequence alignment, scores the cost of obtaining one of the sequences from the others by mutation and recombination. The algorithm comes with an illustrative visualization tool for locating recombination breakpoints. We analyze the sequence alignment with respect to all choices of the parameter alpha weighting recombination cost against mutation cost. The analysis of the resulting cost curve yields additional information as to which sequence might be recombinant. On random genealogies Recco is comparable in its power of detecting recombination with the algorithm Geneconv (Sawyer, 1989). For specific relevant recombination scenarios Recco significantly outperforms Geneconv.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV has posed a significant challenge due to the ability of the virus to both impair and evade the host's immune system. One of the most important mechanisms it has employed to do so is the modulation of the host's native apoptotic pathways and mechanisms. Viral proteins alter normal apoptotic signaling resulting in increased viral load and the formation of viral reservoirs which ultimately increase infectivity. Both the host's pro- and anti-apoptotic responses are regulated by the interactions of viral proteins with cell surface receptors or apoptotic pathway components. This dynamic has led to the development of therapies aimed at altering the ability of the virus to modulate apoptotic pathways. These therapies are aimed at preventing or inhibiting viral infection, or treating viral associated pathologies. These drugs target both the viral proteins and the apoptotic pathways of the host. This review will examine the cell types targeted by HIV, the surface receptors exploited by the virus and the mechanisms whereby HIV encoded proteins influence the apoptotic pathways. The viral manipulation of the hosts' cell type to evade the immune system, establish viral reservoirs and enhance viral proliferation will be reviewed. The pathologies associated with the ability of HIV to alter apoptotic signaling and the drugs and therapies currently under development that target the ability of apoptotic signaling within HIV infection will also be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Apoptosis has been suggested to be one of the major mechanisms of depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals. Remarkably, HIV-1-infected cells appear protected from apoptosis, whereas bystander cells show increased apoptosis in lymph nodes of infected individuals. In this work, we present evidence that the trans-activating protein of HIV-1, Tat, has a dual role in regulation of apoptosis in T cells. While addition of exogenous Tat protein induced apoptosis in uninfected T cells, T cell clones stably expressing the Tat protein were protected from activation-induced apoptosis. The addition of exogenous Tat potentiated anti-CD3 mAb, anti-Fas IgM mAb, and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of T cells. Pretreatment of Tat with anti-Tat Ab abrogated Tat-induced apoptosis, but did not affect anti-Fas IgM Ab-induced apoptosis. Endogenously expressed Tat was analyzed in Jurkat T cell clones transfected with either full-length tat gene (101 amino acids), or in control cells containing an empty vector. The Tat101-transfected clones were resistant to anti-CD3-induced apoptosis, when compared with cells transfected with vector alone. Furthermore, cross-linking of CD4 molecules on T cells with gp160 and anti-gp160 Ab showed markedly decreased apoptosis in Tat101 cells compared with that induced in cells transfected with vector alone. Taken together, our results indicate that HIV-1 Tat can regulate apoptosis that may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.},

We collected several billion mate-paired reads yielding approximately 18x haploid coverage of aligned sequence and close to 300x clone coverage. Over 98\% of the reference genome is covered with at least one uniquely placed read, and 99.65\% is spanned by at least one uniquely placed mate-paired clone. We identify over 3.8 million SNPs, 19\% of which are novel. Mate-paired data are used to physically resolve haplotype phases of nearly two-thirds of the genotypes obtained and produce phased segments of up to 215 kb. We detect 226,529 intra-read indels, 5590 indels between mate-paired reads, 91 inversions, and four gene fusions. We use a novel approach for detecting indels between mate-paired reads that are smaller than the standard deviation of the insert size of the library and discover deletions in common with those detected with our intra-read approach. Dozens of mutations previously described in OMIM and hundreds of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide and structural variants in genes previously implicated in disease are identified in this individual. There is more genetic variation in the human genome still to be uncovered, and we provide guidance for future surveys in populations and cancer biopsies.},

  Abstract                 = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas—the most common type of adult brain cancer—and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {The regulation of gene expression is critical for organismal function and is an important source of phenotypic diversity between species. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulatory divergence is therefore expected to provide insight into evolutionary change. Using deep sequencing, we quantified total and allele-specific mRNA expression levels genome-wide in two closely related Drosophila species (D. melanogaster and D. sechellia) and their F(1) hybrids. We show that 78\% of expressed genes have divergent expression between species, and that cis- and trans-regulatory divergence affects 51\% and 66\% of expressed genes, respectively, with 35\% of genes showing evidence of both. This is a relatively larger contribution of trans-regulatory divergence than was expected based on prior studies, and may result from the unique demographic history of D. sechellia. Genes with antagonistic cis- and trans-regulatory changes were more likely to be misexpressed in hybrids, consistent with the idea that such regulatory changes contribute to hybrid incompatibilities. In addition, cis-regulatory differences contributed more to divergent expression of genes that showed additive rather than nonadditive inheritance. A correlation between sequence similarity and the conservation of cis-regulatory activity was also observed that appears to be a general feature of regulatory evolution. Finally, we examined regulatory divergence that may have contributed to the evolution of a specific trait--divergent feeding behavior in D. sechellia. Overall, this study illustrates the power of mRNA sequencing for investigating regulatory evolution, provides novel insight into the evolution of gene expression in Drosophila, and reveals general trends that are likely to extend to other species.},

  Abstract                 = {Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing can join exons contained on either a single pre-mRNA (cis) or on separate pre-mRNAs (trans). It is exceedingly rare to have trans-splicing between protein-coding exons and has been demonstrated for only two Drosophila genes: mod(mdg4) and lola. It has also been suggested that trans-splicing is a mechanism for the generation of chimeric RNA products containing sequence from multiple distant genomic sites. Because most high-throughput approaches cannot distinguish cis- and trans-splicing events, the extent to which trans-splicing occurs between protein-coding exons in any organism is unknown. Here, we used paired-end deep sequencing of mRNA to identify genes that undergo trans-splicing in Drosophila interspecies hybrids. We did not observe credible evidence for the existence of chimeric RNAs generated by trans-splicing of RNAs transcribed from distant genomic loci. Rather, our data suggest that experimental artifacts are the source of most, if not all, apparent chimeric RNA products. We did, however, identify 80 genes that appear to undergo trans-splicing between homologous alleles and can be classified into three categories based on their organization: (i) genes with multiple 3' terminal exons, (ii) genes with multiple first exons, and (iii) genes with very large introns, often containing other genes. Our results suggest that trans-splicing between homologous alleles occurs more commonly in Drosophila than previously believed and may facilitate expression of architecturally complex genes.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A feature common to all DNA sequencing technologies is the presence of base-call errors in the sequenced reads. The implications of such errors are application specific, ranging from minor informatics nuisances to major problems affecting biological inferences. Recently developed ``next-gen'' sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of sequencing, but have been shown to be more error prone than previous technologies. Both position specific (depending on the location in the read) and sequence specific (depending on the sequence in the read) errors have been identified in Illumina and Life Technology sequencing platforms. We describe a new type of systematic error that manifests as statistically unlikely accumulations of errors at specific genome (or transcriptome) locations. RESULTS: We characterize and describe systematic errors using overlapping paired reads form high-coverage data. We show that such errors occur in approximately 1 in 1000 base pairs, and that they are highly replicable across experiments. We identify motifs that are frequent at systematic error sites, and describe a classifier that distinguishes heterozygous sites from systematic error. Our classifier is designed to accommodate data from experiments in which the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites are not necessarily 0.5 (such as in the case of RNA-Seq), and can be used with single-end datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic errors can easily be mistaken for heterozygous sites in individuals, or for SNPs in population analyses. Systematic errors are particularly problematic in low coverage experiments, or in estimates of allele-specific expression from RNA-Seq data. Our characterization of systematic error has allowed us to develop a program, called SysCall, for identifying and correcting such errors. We conclude that correction of systematic errors is important to consider in the design and interpretation of high-throughput sequencing experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Several distinct families of endogenous retrovirus-like sequences (HERVs) exist in the genomes of humans and other primates. One of these families, the HERV-K group, contains members that encode functional proteins and that have been implicated in the etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Because of potential functional and disease relevance, it is important to determine if there are HERV-K-associated genetic differences between individuals. In this study, we have investigated the divergence and evolutionary age of HERV-K long terminal repeats (LTRs). Thirty-seven LTRs, taken primarily from random human clones in GenBank, were aligned and grouped into nine clusters with decreasing sequence divergence. Cluster 1 sequences are 8.6\% divergent, on average, whereas cluster 9 LTRs, represented by the LTRs of the fully sequenced HERV-K10 clone, show an average of only 1.1\% divergence from each other. The evolutionary age of 18 LTRs from different clusters was then investigated by genomic PCR to determine presence or absence of the retroviral element in different primate species. LTRs from clusters of higher divergence were detected in monkeys and apes, whereas LTRs in clusters with lower divergence were acquired later in evolution. Notably, LTRs of cluster 9 were found only in humans at all nine loci examined. Genomic Southern analysis with an oligonucleotide probe specific for cluster 9 LTRs suggests that HERV-K elements with this type of LTR expanded independently in the genomes of humans and the great apes. This is the first report of endogenous retroviral integrations that are specific to humans and indicates that some HERVs have amplified much later than previously thought. These elements may still be actively transposing and may therefore represent a source of genetic variation linked to disease development.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the performance of WHO clinical and CD4 cell count criteria for antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure among HIV-infected adults in a workplace HIV care programme in South Africa.Cohort study.We included initially ART-naive participants who remained on first-line therapy and had an evaluable HIV viral load result at the 12-month visit. WHO-defined clinical and CD4 cell count criteria for ART failure were compared against a gold standard of virological failure.Among 324 individuals (97.5\% men, median age 40.2, median starting CD4 cell count and viral load 154 cells/mul and 47,503 copies/ml, respectively), 33 (10.2\%) had definite or probable virological failure at 12 months, compared with 19 (6.0\%) and 40 (12.5\%) with WHO-defined CD4 and clinical failure, respectively. CD4 criteria had a sensitivity of 21.2\% and a specificity of 95.8\% in detecting virological failure, and clinical criteria had sensitivity of 15.2\% and specificity of 88.1\%. The positive predictive value of CD4 and clinical criteria in detecting virological failure were 36.8 and 12.8\%, respectively. Exclusion of weight loss or tuberculosis failed to improve the performance of clinical criteria.WHO clinical and CD4 criteria have poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting virological failure. The low specificities and positive predictive values mean that individuals with adequate virological suppression risk being incorrectly classified as having treatment failure and unnecessarily switched to second-line therapy. Virological failure should be confirmed before switching to second-line therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Premature termination codons induce rapid transcript degradation in eukaryotic cells through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This pathway can modulate phenotypes arising from nonsense or frameshift mutations, but little is known about the physiologic role of NMD in higher eukaryotes. To address this issue, we examined expression profiles in mammalian cells depleted of Rent1 (also called hUpf1), a factor essential for NMD. Upregulated transcripts included those with upstream open reading frames in the 5' untranslated region, alternative splicing that introduces nonsense codons or frameshifts, introns in the 3' untranslated region or selenocysteine codons. Transcripts derived from ancient transposons and endogenous retroviruses were also upregulated. These RNAs are unified by the presence of a spliced intron at least 50 nucleotides downstream of a termination codon, a context sufficient to initiate NMD. Consistent with direct regulation by NMD, representative upregulated transcripts decayed more slowly in cells deficient in NMD. In addition, inhibition of NMD induced by amino acid starvation upregulated transcripts that promote amino acid homeostasis. These results document that nonsense surveillance is a crucial post-transcriptional regulatory event that influences the expression of broad classes of physiologic transcripts, has been functionally incorporated into essential homeostatic mechanisms and suppresses expression of evolutionary remnants.},

  Abstract                 = {Governments and international donors have partnered to provide free HIV treatment to over 6 million individuals in low and middle-income countries. Understanding the determinants of HIV treatment costs will help improve efficiency and provide greater certainty about future resource needs.We collected data on HIV treatment costs from 54 clinical sites in Botswana, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda, and Vietnam. Sites provided free HIV treatment funded by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), national governments, and other partners. Service delivery costs were categorized into successive six-month periods from the date when each site began HIV treatment scale-up. A generalized linear mixed model was used to investigate relationships between site characteristics and per-patient costs, excluding ARV expenses. With predictors at their mean values, average annual per-patient costs were $177 (95\% CI: 127-235) for pre-ART patients, $353 (255-468) for adult patients in the first 6 months of ART, and $222 (161-296) for adult patients on ART for >6 months (excludes ARV costs). Patient volume (no. patients receiving treatment) and site maturity (months since clinic began providing treatment services) were both strong independent predictors of per-patient costs. Controlling for other factors, costs declined by 43\% (18-63) as patient volume increased from 500 to 5,000 patients, and by 28\% (6-47) from 5,000 to 10,000 patients. For site maturity, costs dropped 41\% (28-52) between months 0-12 and 25\% (15-35) between months 12-24. Price levels (proxied by per-capita GDP) were also influential, with costs increasing by 22\% (4-41) for each doubling in per-capita GDP. Additionally, the frequency of clinical follow-up, frequency of laboratory monitoring, and clinician-patient ratio were significant independent predictors of per-patient costs.Substantial reductions in per-patient service delivery costs occur as sites mature and patient cohorts increase in size. Other predictors suggest possible strategies to reduce per-patient costs.},

RNA capture sequencing (CaptureSeq) addresses this challenge by using oligonucleotide probes to capture selected genes or regions of interest for targeted sequencing. Targeted RNAseq provides enhanced coverage for sensitive gene discovery, robust transcript assembly and accurate gene quantification. Here we describe a detailed protocol for all stages of RNA CaptureSeq, from initial probe design considerations and capture of targeted genes to final assembly and quantification of captured transcripts. Initial probe design and final analysis can take less than 1 d, whereas the central experimental capture stage requires ∼7 d.},

We use the unprecedented depth of coverage afforded by this technique to reach the deepest limits of the human transcriptome, exposing widespread, regulated and remarkably complex noncoding transcription in intergenic regions, as well as unannotated exons and splicing patterns in even intensively studied protein-coding loci such as p53 and HOX. The data also show that intermittent sequenced reads observed in conventional RNA sequencing data sets, previously dismissed as noise, are in fact indicative of unassembled rare transcripts. Collectively, these results reveal the range, depth and complexity of a human transcriptome that is far from fully characterized.},

  Abstract                 = {Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been classified as a simple retrovirus with two accessory genes, dut and sag. Cloned MMTV proviruses carrying a trimethoprim (trim) cassette in the envelope gene were defective for Gag protein production and the nuclear export of unspliced gag-pol RNA. Complementation experiments indicated that a trans-acting product was responsible for the Gag defect of such mutants. Analysis of MMTV-infected cells revealed the presence of a novel, doubly spliced RNA that encodes a putative product of 301 amino acids. Overexpression of cDNA from this RNA increased Gag levels from env mutant proviruses or reporter gene expression from unspliced mRNAs and allowed detection of a 33-kDa protein product, which has been named regulator of export of MMTV mRNA, or Rem. The Rem N terminus has motifs similar to the Rev-like export proteins of complex retroviruses, and mutation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) abolished RNA export and detection within the nucleus. The Rem C terminus has few identifiable features, but removal of this domain increased Rem-mediated export, suggesting an autoregulatory function. A reporter vector developed from the 3' end of the MMTV provirus was Rem responsive and required both the presence of the MMTV env-U3 junction and a functional Crm1 pathway. The identification of a third accessory protein from a doubly spliced transcript suggests that MMTV is the first murine complex retrovirus to be documented. Manipulation of the MMTV genome may provide mouse models for human retroviral diseases, such as AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, functional defects and deletion of antigen-reactive T cells are more frequent than can be explained by direct viral infection. On culturing, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals died as a result of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis was enhanced by activation with CD3 antibodies. Programmed cell death, associated with impaired T cell reactivity, may thus be responsible for the deletion of reactive T cells that contributes to HIV-induced immunodeficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-1 Rev protein is a nuclear trans-activator essential for the transport of unspliced viral transcripts to the cytoplasm. In this paper we demonstrate that Rev, rather than being confined to the nucleus, is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We also show that inactivation of Rev's leucine-rich activation domain generates mutant proteins that not only fail to induce the nuclear export of viral transcripts but are also unable to enter the cytoplasm. On the basis of this correlation, we propose that Rev activates viral mRNA transport by directly binding to these RNAs and translocating, with them, to the cytoplasm. In addition, these results also identify, for the first time, a peptide sequence that is important for nuclear export.},

We examined how a virus, bacteriophage λ, evolved to infect its host, Escherichia coli, through a novel pathway. Natural selection promoted the fixation of mutations in the virus's host-recognition protein, J, that improved fitness on the original receptor, LamB, and set the stage for other mutations that allowed infection through a new receptor, OmpF. These viral mutations arose after the host evolved reduced expression of LamB, whereas certain other host mutations prevented the phage from evolving the new function. This study shows the complex interplay between genomic processes and ecological conditions that favor the emergence of evolutionary innovations.},

As of September 2012, genomic sequence and a basic set of annotation 'tracks' are provided for 63 organisms, including 26 mammals, 13 non-mammal vertebrates, 3 invertebrate deuterostomes, 13 insects, 6 worms, yeast and sea hare. In the past year 19 new genome assemblies have been added, and we anticipate releasing another 28 in early 2013. Further, a large number of annotation tracks have been either added, updated by contributors or remapped to the latest human reference genome. Among these are an updated UCSC Genes track for human and mouse assemblies. We have also introduced several features to improve usability, including new navigation menus. This article provides an update to the UCSC Genome Browser database, which has been previously featured in the Database issue of this journal.},

However, routine 454 sequencing applications still require microgram quantities of initial material. This is due to a lack of effective methods for quantifying 454 sequencing libraries, necessitating expensive and labour-intensive procedures when sequencing ancient DNA and other poor DNA samples. Here we report a 454 sequencing library quantification method based on quantitative PCR that effectively eliminates these limitations. We estimated both the molecule numbers and the fragment size distributions in sequencing libraries derived from Neandertal DNA extracts, SAGE ditags and bonobo genomic DNA, obtaining optimal sequencing yields without performing any titration runs. Using this method, 454 sequencing can routinely be performed from as little as 50 pg of initial material without titration runs, thereby drastically reducing costs while increasing the scope of sample throughput and protocol development on the 454 platform. The method should also apply to Illumina/Solexa and ABI/SOLiD sequencing, and should therefore help to widen the accessibility of all three platforms.},

  Abstract                 = {Parallel tagged sequencing (PTS) is a molecular barcoding method designed to adapt the recently developed high-throughput 454 parallel sequencing technology for use with multiple samples. Unlike other barcoding methods, PTS can be applied to any type of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sample, including shotgun DNA libraries and pools of PCR products, and requires no amplification or gel purification steps. The method relies on attaching sample-specific barcoding adapters, which include sequence tags and a restriction site, to blunt-end repaired DNA samples by ligation and strand-displacement. After pooling multiple barcoded samples, molecules without sequence tags are effectively excluded from sequencing by dephosphorylation and restriction digestion, and using the tag sequences, the source of each DNA sequence can be traced. This protocol allows for sequencing 300 or more complete mitochondrial genomes on a single 454 GS FLX run, or twenty-five 6-kb plasmid sequences on only one 16th plate region. Most of the reactions can be performed in a multichannel setup on 96-well reaction plates, allowing for processing up to several hundreds of samples in a few days.},

These findings were confirmed in natural infection by analysis of RNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 15 HIV-1-infected patients. A cDNA derived from a 2.3-kb polyadenylated HIV-1 RNA with negative-strand polarity which encodes a highly conserved 189-amino-acid open reading frame antiparallel to the envelope gene was isolated from acutely infected A3.01 cells. Through use of reporter gene constructions, we further found that a novel negative-strand promoter functions within the negative response element of the 3' long terminal repeat, which is downregulated by coexpression of Tat. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that NF-kappa B I and USF sites are crucial for negative-strand promoter activity. These data extend the coding capacity of HIV-1 and suggest a role for antisense regulation of the viral life cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Viruses frequently render cells refractory to subsequent infection with the same virus. This state of superinfection immunity counteracts potentially detrimental consequences for the infected cell and facilitates high-level replication and viral spread in the host.Here, we show that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) employs its early gene product Nef to efficiently interfere with superinfection at the viral-entry step. In this context, we identify the downregulation of cell-surface CCR5, the major HIV coreceptor, as a novel and highly conserved activity of Nef. Nef targets the CCR5 coreceptor and the HIV binding receptor CD4 via distinct cellular machineries to enhance the endocytosis rate of both HIV receptor components and to accelerate their degradation. Functionally, these genetically separable actions by Nef synergized to efficiently protect cells from HIV superinfection at the level of fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane.HIV has evolved two independent activities for Nef to downregulate the receptor complex and to facilitate its efficient replication and spread. This evasion strategy likely represents a mechanism by which the pathogenicity factor Nef elevates viral replication in vivo and thus promotes AIDS pathogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Oxford Nanopore's third-generation single-molecule sequencing platform promises to decrease costs for reagents and instrumentation. After a 2-year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10\% identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 ± 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16× coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.},

By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Tat specific factor 1 (Tat-SF1) interacts with components of both the transcription and splicing machineries and has been classified as a transcription-splicing factor. Although its function as an HIV-1 dependency factor has been investigated, relatively little is known about the cellular functions of Tat-SF1. To identify target genes of Tat-SF1, we utilized a combination of RNAi and exon-specific microarrays. These arrays, which survey genome-wide changes in transcript and individual exon levels, revealed 450 genes with transcript level changes upon Tat-SF1 depletion. Strikingly, 98\% of these target genes were down-regulated upon depletion, indicating that Tat-SF1 generally activates gene expression. We also identified 89 genes that showed differential exon level changes after Tat-SF1 depletion. The 89 genes showed evidence of many different types of alternative exon use consistent with the regulation of transcription initiation sites and RNA processing. Minimal overlap between genes with transcript-level and exon-level changes suggests that Tat-SF1 does not functionally couple transcription and splicing. Biological processes significantly enriched with transcript- and exon-level targets include the cell cycle and nucleic acid metabolism; the insulin signaling pathway was enriched with Tat-SF1 transcript-level targets but not exon-level targets. Additionally, a hexamer, ATGCCG, was over-represented in the promoter region of genes showing changes in transcription initiation upon Tat-SF1 depletion. This may represent a novel motif that Tat-SF1 recognizes during transcription. Together, these findings suggest that Tat-SF1 functions independently in transcription and splicing of cellular genes.},

We identify an arginine/serine-rich region of U2AF 65 that mediates an interaction with an RS-like alternating charge domain of the 59 kDa subunit of the human cleavage factor I (CF I(m)), an essential 3' processing factor that functions at an early step in the recognition of the 3' end processing signal. Tethered functional analysis shows that the U2AF 65/CF I(m) 59 interaction stimulates in vitro 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation. These results therefore uncover a direct role of the U2AF 65/CF I(m) 59 interaction in the functional coordination of splicing and 3' end processing.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The generation and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is becoming a major component of many studies in molecular biology and medical research. Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) and HiSeq instruments are currently the most widely used sequencing devices. Here, we comprehensively evaluate properties of genomic HiSeq and GAIIx data derived from two plant genomes and one virus, with read lengths of 95-150 bases. RESULTS: We provide quantifications and evidence for GC bias, error rates, error sequence context, effects of quality filtering, and the reliability of quality values. By combining different filtering criteria we reduced error rates 7-fold at the expense of discarding 12.5\% of alignable bases. While overall error rates are low in HiSeq data we observed regions of accumulated wrong base calls. Only 3\% of all error positions accounted for 24.7\% of all substitution errors. Analyzing the forward and reverse strand separately revealed error rates of up to 18.7\%. Insertions and deletions occurred at very low rates on average but increased to up to 2\% in homopolymers. A positive correlation between read coverage and GC content was found depending on the GC content range. CONCLUSIONS: The errors and biases we report have implications on the use and the interpretation of Illumina sequencing data. GAIIx and HiSeq data sets show slightly different error profiles. Quality filtering is essential to minimize downstream analysis artifacts. Supporting previous recommendations, the strand-specificity provides a criterion to distinguish sequencing errors from low abundance polymorphisms.},

Previous work suggested that the incoming viral genome may under some circumstances be detected as DNA damage, so to explore this possibility, we compared the transcriptional response to infection with an HIV-based vector to the response to treatment with the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Expression levels of about 12,000 cellular RNA transcripts were determined in a human B-cell line at different times after either treatment. Statistical analysis revealed that the infection with the lentivirus vector resulted in quite modest changes in gene expression. Treatment with etoposide, in contrast, caused drastic changes in expression of genes known or inferred to be involved in apoptosis. Statistically significant though subtle parallels in the cellular transcriptional responses to etoposide treatment and HIV-vector infection could be detected. Several further data sets analyzing infections with HIV-based vectors or wild-type HIV-1 showed similar modest effects on cellular transcription and very modest parallels among different data sets. These findings establish that HIV-vector or HIV-1 infection has remarkably little effect on cellular transcription. The statistical methods described here may be of wide use in mining microarray data sets. Our observations support the idea that gene therapy with HIV-based vectors should not be particularly toxic to cells due to disruption of cellular transcription.},

We compared retroviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV), and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Effects of gene activity on integration targeting were assessed by transcriptional profiling of infected cells. Integration by HIV vectors, analyzed in two primary cell types and several cell lines, strongly favored active genes. An analysis of the effects of tissue-specific transcription showed that it resulted in tissue-specific integration targeting by HIV, though the effect was quantitatively modest. Chromosomal regions rich in expressed genes were favored for HIV integration, but these regions were found to be interleaved with unfavorable regions at CpG islands. MLV vectors showed a strong bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites, as reported previously. ASLV vectors showed only a weak preference for active genes and no preference for transcription start regions. Thus, each of the three retroviruses studied showed unique integration site preferences, suggesting that virus-specific binding of integration complexes to chromatin features likely guides site selection.},

  Abstract                 = {We have constructed a non-primate lentiviral vector system based on the equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV). This system is able to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, including primary cultured hippocampal neurons and neurons and glia in the adult rat central nervous system (CNS), at efficiencies comparable with HIV-based vectors. We demonstrate that the only EIAV proteins required for this activity are gag/pol and that the only accessory protein required for vector production is rev. In addition, we show that the pol encoded dUTPase activity that is found in all non-primate lentiviruses is not required. The vectors can be pseudotyped with a range of envelopes including rabies G and MLV 4070A and can be concentrated to high titres. The ability of EIAV to infect mitotically inactive cells makes this vector an attractive alternative to the immunodeficiency viruses for gene therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Messenger RNA surveillance, the selective and rapid degradation of mRNAs containing premature stop codons, occurs in all eukaryotes tested. The biological role of this decay pathway, however, is not well understood. To identify natural substrates of mRNA surveillance, we used a cDNA-based representational difference analysis to identify mRNAs whose abundance increases in Caenorhabditis elegans smg(-) mutants, which are deficient for mRNA surveillance. Alternatively spliced mRNAs of genes encoding ribosomal proteins L3, L7a, L10a, and L12 are abundant natural targets of mRNA surveillance. Each of these genes expresses two distinct mRNAs. A productively spliced mRNA, whose abundance does not change in smg(-) mutants, encodes a normal, full-length, ribosomal protein. An unproductively spliced mRNA, whose abundance increases dramatically in smg(-) mutants, contains premature stop codons because of incomplete removal of an alternatively spliced intron. In transgenic animals expressing elevated quantities of RPL-12, a greater proportion of endogenous rpl-12 transcript is spliced unproductively. Thus, RPL-12 appears to autoregulate its own splicing, with unproductively spliced mRNAs being degraded by mRNA surveillance. We demonstrate further that alternative splicing of rpl introns is conserved among widely diverged nematodes. Our results suggest that one important role of mRNA surveillance is to eliminate unproductive by-products of gene regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {We have constructed a new series of lentivirus vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that can transduce nondividing cells. The U3 region of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) in vector constructs was replaced with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, resulting in Tat-independent transcription but still maintaining high levels of expression. A self-inactivating (SIN) vector was constructed by deleting 133 bp in the U3 region of the 3' LTR, including the TATA box and binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and NF-kappaB. The deletion is transferred to the 5' LTR after reverse transcription and integration in infected cells, resulting in the transcriptional inactivation of the LTR in the proviruses. SIN viruses can be generated with no significant decreases in titer. Injection of viruses into the rat brain showed that a SIN vector containing the green fluorescent protein gene under the control of the internal CMV promoter transduced neurons as efficiently as a wild-type vector. Interestingly, a wild-type vector without an internal promoter also successfully transduced neurons in the brain, indicating that the HIV-1 LTR promoter is transcriptionally active in neurons even in the absence of Tat. Furthermore, injection of viruses into the subretinal space of the rat eye showed that wild-type vector transduced predominantly retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells, while SIN vector was able to transduce other types of retinal cells, including bipolar, Müller, horizontal, and amacrine cells. This finding suggests that the HIV-1 LTR can negatively influence the internal CMV promoter in some cell types. SIN HIV vectors should be safer for gene therapy, and they also have broader applicability as a means of high-level gene transfer and expression in nondividing cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously we designed novel pseudotyped high-titer replication defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors to deliver genes into nondividing cells (J. Reiser, G. Harmison, S. Kluepfel-Stahl, R. O. Brady, S. Karlsson, and M. Schubert, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:15266-15271, 1996). Since then we have made several improvements with respect to the safety, flexibility, and efficiency of the vector system. A three-plasmid expression system is used to generate pseudotyped HIV-1 particles by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with a defective packaging construct, a plasmid coding for a heterologous envelope (Env) protein, and a vector construct harboring a reporter gene such as neo, ShlacZ (encoding a phleomycin resistance/beta-galactosidase fusion protein), HSA (encoding mouse heat-stable antigen), or EGFP (encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein). The packaging constructs lack functional Vif, Vpr, and Vpu proteins and/or a large portion of the Env coding region as well as the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats, the Nef function, and the presumed packaging signal. Using G418 selection, we routinely obtained vector particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) with titers of up to 8 x 10(7) CFU/microgram of p24, provided that a functional Tat coding region was present in the vector. Vector constructs lacking a functional Tat protein yielded titers of around 4 x 10(6) to 8 x 10(6) CFU/microgram of p24. Packaging constructs with a mutation within the integrase (IN) core domain profoundly affected colony formation and expression of the reporter genes, indicating that a functional IN protein is required for efficient transduction. We explored the abilities of other Env proteins to allow formation of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles. The rabies virus and Mokola virus G proteins yielded high-titer infectious pseudotypes, while the human foamy virus Env protein did not. Using the improved vector system, we successfully transduced contact-inhibited primary human skin fibroblasts and postmitotic rat cerebellar neurons and cardiac myocytes, a process not affected by the lack of the accessory proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most interesting opportunities in comparative genomics is to compare not only genome sequences but additional phenomena, such as alternative splicing, using orthologous genes in different genomes to find similarities and differences between organisms. Recently, genomics studies have suggested that 40-60\% of human genes are alternatively spliced and have catalogued up to 30,000 alternative splice relationships in human genes. Here we report an analysis of 9,434 orthologous genes in human and mouse, which indicates that alternative splicing is associated with a large increase in frequency of recent exon creation and/or loss. Whereas most exons in the mouse and human genomes are strongly conserved in both genomes, exons that are only included in alternative splice forms (as opposed to the constitutive or major transcript form) are mostly not conserved and thus are the product of recent exon creation or loss events. A similar comparison of orthologous exons in rat and human validates this pattern. Although this says nothing about the complex question of adaptive benefit, it does indicate that alternative splicing in these genomes has been associated with increased evolutionary change.},

We observed 7,991 (73\%) of the 10,958 expressed genes to be modulated in concordance with key steps of viral replication. Fifty-two percent of the overall variability in the host transcriptome was explained by linear regression on the viral life cycle. This profound perturbation of cellular physiology was investigated in the light of several regulatory mechanisms, including transcription factors, miRNAs, host-pathogen interaction, and proviral integration. Key features were validated in primary CD4+ T cells, and with viral constructs using alternative entry strategies. We propose a model of early massive cellular shutdown and progressive upregulation of the cellular machinery to complete the viral life cycle.},

Integration into transcribed genes also has the potential to deregulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by interfering with splicing and polyadenylation of primary transcripts. To examine the impact of retroviral vector integration on transcript splicing, we transduced primary human cells or cultured cells with HIV-derived vectors carrying a reporter gene or a human β-globin gene under the control of a reduced-size locus-control region (LCR). Cells were randomly cloned and integration sites were determined in individual clones. We identified aberrantly spliced, chimeric transcripts in more than half of the targeted genes in all cell types. Chimeric transcripts were generated through the use of constitutive and cryptic splice sites in the HIV 5ι long terminal repeat and gag gene as well as in the β-globin gene and LCR. Compared with constitutively spliced transcripts, most aberrant transcripts accumulated at a low level, at least in part as a consequence of nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation. A limited set of cryptic splice sites caused the majority of aberrant splicing events, providing a strategy for recoding lentiviral vector backbones and transgenes to reduce their potential posttranscriptional genotoxicity.},

Substantial progress has been made in the development of newer antiretroviral therapies that have a better metabolic profile with respect to dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and lipodystrophy.

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) co-opts host proteins and cellular machineries to its advantage at every step of the replication cycle. Here we show that HIV-1 enhances heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 expression and promotes the relocalization of hnRNP A1 to the cytoplasm. The latter was dependent on the nuclear export of the unspliced viral genomic RNA (vRNA) and to alterations in the abundance and localization of the FG-repeat nuclear pore glycoprotein p62. hnRNP A1 and vRNA remain colocalized in the cytoplasm supporting a post-nuclear function during the late stages of HIV-1 replication. Consistently, we show that hnRNP A1 acts as an internal ribosomal entry site trans-acting factor up-regulating internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation initiation of the HIV-1 vRNA. The up-regulation and cytoplasmic retention of hnRNP A1 by HIV-1 would ensure abundant expression of viral structural proteins in cells infected with HIV-1.},

These cells undergo abortive infection characterized by the cytosolic accumulation of incomplete HIV reverse transcripts. These viral DNAs are sensed by an unidentified host sensor that triggers an innate immune response, leading to caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. Using unbiased proteomic and targeted biochemical approaches, as well as two independent methods of lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated gene knockdown in primary CD4 T cells, we identify interferon-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) as a host DNA sensor required for CD4 T cell death due to abortive HIV infection. These findings provide insights into a key host pathway that plays a central role in CD4 T cell depletion during disease progression to AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {Current guidelines recommend that individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) be treated using combinations of antiretroviral agents to achieve sustained suppression of viral replication as measured by the plasma HIV-1 RNA assay, in the hopes of achieving prolonged remission of the disease. However, until recently, many drug combinations have not led to sustained suppression of HIV-1 RNA.To compare the virologic effects of various combinations of nevirapine, didanosine, and zidovudine.Double-blind, controlled, randomized trial.University-affiliated ambulatory research clinics in Italy, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia (INCAS).Antiretroviral therapy-naive adults free of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with CD4 cell counts between 0.20 and 0.60x10(9)/L (200-600/microL).Patients received zidovudine plus nevirapine (plus didanosine placebo), zidovudine plus didanosine (plus nevirapine placebo), or zidovudine plus didanosine plus nevirapine.Plasma HIV-1 RNA.Of the 153 enrolled patients, 151 were evaluable. At week 8, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels had decreased by log 2.18, 1.55, and 0.90 in the triple drug therapy, zidovudine plus didanosine, and zidovudine plus nevirapine groups, respectively (P<.05). The proportions of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels below 20 copies per milliliter at week 52 were 51\%, 12\%, and 0\% in the triple drug therapy, zidovudine plus didanosine, and zidovudine plus nevirapine groups, respectively (P<.001). Viral amplification was attempted in 59 patients at 6 months. Viral isolation was unsuccessful in 19 (79\%) of 24, 10 (53\%) of 19, and 5 (31\%) of 16 patients in the triple drug therapy, zidovudine plus didanosine, and zidovudine plus nevirapine groups, respectively. Among patients from whom virus could be amplified, resistance to nevirapine was found in all 11 patients receiving zidovudine plus nevirapine and in all 5 patients receiving triple drug therapy. Rates of disease progression or death were 23\% (11/47), 25\% (13/53), and 12\% (6/51) for the zidovudine plus nevirapine, zidovudine plus didanosine, and triple drug therapy groups, respectively (P=.08).Triple drug therapy with zidovudine, didanosine, and nevirapine led to a substantially greater and sustained decrease in plasma viral load than the 2-drug regimens studied. Our results also suggest that suppression of viral replication, as demonstrated by a decrease in the plasma HIV-1 RNA load below the level of quantitation of the most sensitive test available, may at least forestall the development of resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutational (genetic) robustness is phenotypic constancy in the face of mutational changes to the genome. Robustness is critical to the understanding of evolution because phenotypically expressed genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection. Nonetheless, the evidence for adaptive evolution of mutational robustness in biological populations is controversial. Robustness should be selectively favored when mutation rates are high, a common feature of RNA viruses. However, selection for robustness may be relaxed under virus co-infection because complementation between virus genotypes can buffer mutational effects. We therefore hypothesized that selection for genetic robustness in viruses will be weakened with increasing frequency of co-infection. To test this idea, we used populations of RNA phage phi6 that were experimentally evolved at low and high levels of co-infection and subjected lineages of these viruses to mutation accumulation through population bottlenecking. The data demonstrate that viruses evolved under high co-infection show relatively greater mean magnitude and variance in the fitness changes generated by addition of random mutations, confirming our hypothesis that they experience weakened selection for robustness. Our study further suggests that co-infection of host cells may be advantageous to RNA viruses only in the short term. In addition, we observed higher mutation frequencies in the more robust viruses, indicating that evolution of robustness might foster less-accurate genome replication in RNA viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of protease inhibitor-containing (PI) combination antiretroviral therapy has led to a reduction in the incidence of opportunistic illness and mortality (events) in HIV infection. We wished to quantify the changing incidence of these events in our clinical practice and delineate the relationship between CD4, HIV-1 RNA, and development of events in patients receiving PI combination therapy.We assessed HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts < or =500 cells x10(6)/l. We calculated the incidence of events from 1994 through 1998 and analyzed the association of temporal changes in event incidence and use of antiretroviral therapy. In patients on PI combination therapy, we determined the probability of achieving and maintaining an undetectable HIV-1 RNA response and determined the association of CD4, HIV-1 RNA, and developing an event.The incidence of opportunistic illness declined from 23.7 events/100 person-years in 1994 to 14.0 events/100 person-years in 1998 (P<0.001). Mortality declined from 20.2 deaths/100 person-years in 1994 to 8.4 deaths/ 100 person-years in 1998 (P<0.001). Use of PI combination therapy was associated with a relative rate of opportunistic illness or death of 0.66 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-0.85; P<0.001]. The relative incidence of each of 16 opportunistic illnesses was approximately the same in 1998 as in 1994 except for lymphoma, cervical cancer and wasting syndrome which do not appeared to have declined in incidence. Approximately 60\% of patients who received PI therapy achieved an undetectable HIV-1 RNA, and 65\% of these patients maintained durable suppression of HIV-1 RNA. Achieving an undetectable HIV-1 RNA was associated with a decreased risk of an event, and was the variable most strongly associated with an increase in CD4 level. By multivariate analysis, the concurrent CD4 level was most strongly associated with developing an event.We observed a significant decline in the incidence of opportunistic illness and death from 1994 through 1998 associated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Patients who develop events while being treated with PI combination therapy were not likely to have achieved an undetectable HIV-1 RNA and are likely to have a low concurrent CD4 level.},

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex bacteremia, cytomegalovirus, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex occurred at rates of 5 to 9 events per 100 person-years and 3-year Kaplan-Meier probabilities of 0.15 to 0.22. Toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, herpes zoster, the wasting syndrome, and Kaposi sarcoma occurred at rates of about 2 to 4 events per 100 person-years and with 3-year Kaplan-Meier probabilities of 0.05 to 0.10. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, M. tuberculosis infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and cryptosporidiosis were the least common disorders, with an incidence of about 1 to 2 events per 100 person-years and a 3-year Kaplan-Meier probability less than 0.05. Only the incidences of cryptococcal meningitis, secondary P. carinii pneumonia, and herpes zoster decreased (P < 0.05) between 1989-1992 and 1993-1995. Fluconazole use was associated with a decreased relative rate of 0.49 (P = 0.06) for cryptococcal meningitis and a decreased relative rate of 0.61 (P = 0.005) for esophageal candidiasis. Rifabutin use was associated with a decreased relative rate of 0.37 (P = 0.002) for M. avium complex bacteremia, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use was associated with decreased relative rates of 0.33 (P = 0.02) for secondary P. carinii pneumonia and 0.55 (P = 0.08) for primary P. carinii pneumonia. Candidiasis, herpes zoster, and M. tuberculosis infection first occurred at a median CD4+ count greater than 100 cells/mm3, but all other opportunistic diseases first occurred at a median CD4+ count less than 50 cells/mm3. Median survival after diagnosis varied from 35 days for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to 680 days for herpes zoster.In the patients studied, the incidences of secondary P. carinii pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis, and herpes zoster have declined in the past 5 years. The incidences of primary P. carinii pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma appear to be declining compared with historical estimates. However, although these and other opportunistic diseases continue to be relatively frequent complications of HIV infection, they are first occurring at more advanced immunosuppression than in the past. Continued efforts are needed to develop effective strategies for preventing opportunistic disease in very advanced HIV infection.},

Rates of development of specific opportunistic infections or neoplasms and HIV encephalopathy were determined for different baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count ranges. Myelosuppression was significantly more common in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than or equal to 100 x 10(6)/l. Sixty-five per cent of patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 100 x 10(6)/l and 51\% with a CD4+ lymphocyte count less than 100 x 10(6)/l continued to receive zidovudine 2 years after starting therapy.We describe the natural history of a cohort of patients treated with zidovudine for advanced HIV disease. These CD4+ lymphocyte count-stratified estimates of disease progression should provide prognostic information useful in the clinical management of advanced disease and the design of future studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanisms by which opioids affect progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are not well-defined. HIV-1 gp120 is important in the apoptotic death of uninfected, bystander T cells. In this study, we show that co-treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with HIV-1 gp120/morphine synergistically induces apoptosis in PBMC. Co-treatment of murine splenocytes from mu opiate receptor knockout mice with gp120/morphine resulted in decreased apoptosis when compared to splenocytes from wild type mice. Co-treatment of human PBMC or murine splenocytes with gp120/morphine led to decreased expression of beta-arrestin 2, a protein required for opioid-mediated signaling. The role of beta-arrestin 2 was confirmed in Jurkat lymphocytes, in which 1) over-expression of beta-arrestin 2 inhibited gp120/morphine-induced apoptosis and 2) RNA interference of beta-arrestin 2 expression enhanced gp120/morphine-induced apoptosis. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 gp120 and opioids induce lymphocyte cell death.},

Although such approaches have the potential to enumerate transcripts by counting sequence tags derived from them, they typically do not robustly survey the majority of transcripts along their entire length. Here we show that massively parallel sequencing of randomly primed cDNAs, using a next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technology, offers the potential to generate relative measures of mRNA and individual exon abundance while simultaneously profiling the prevalence of both annotated and novel exons and exon-splicing events. This technique identifies known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as novel single-base variants. Analysis of these variants, and previously unannotated splicing events in the HeLa S3 cell line, reveals an overrepresentation of gene categories including those previously implicated in cancer.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads.

We have demonstrated that there is a previously unrecognized temporal order to the appearance of AAV RNAs. First, unspliced P5-generated transcripts, which encode Rep78, were detectable prior to the significant accumulation of other AAV RNAs. Ultimately, as previously demonstrated, P19-generated products accumulated to levels greater than those generated from P5, and P40-generated transcripts predominated in the total RNA pool. Second, the percentage of each class of AAV RNA that was spliced increased during infection, and the degree of this increase was different for the P5/P19 products than for those generated by P40. At late times postcoinfection, approximately 90\% of P40 products, but only approximately 50\% of RNAs generated by P5 and P19, were seen to be spliced; thus, the AAV intron was removed to different final levels from these different RNA species. We have shown that each of the AAV RNAs is quite stable; the majority of each RNA species persisted 6 h after treatment with actinomycin D. Quantification of the accumulation of individual AAV RNAs, over intervals during which degradation was negligible, allowed us to infer that at late times during infection the relative strength of P5, P19, and P40 was approximately 1:3:18, respectively, consistent with the steady-state accumulated levels of the RNAs generated by each promoter. All AAV RNAs exited to the cytoplasm with similar efficiencies in the presence or absence of adenovirus; however, adenovirus coinfection appeared to stimulate total splicing of AAV RNAs and the relative use of the downstream intron acceptor. Our results confirm and extend previous observations concerning the appearance and processing of AAV-generated RNAs.},

We investigated this using humanized NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (hNSG) mice reconstituted with approximately 4-11\% envAS-modified human T-cells. Mice were challenged with HIV-1(NL4-3), which has an env perfectly complementary to envAS, or with HIV-1(BaL), which has a divergent env. No differences were seen in viral titer between mice that received envAS-modified cells and control mice that did not. Using 454/Roche pyrosequencing, we analyzed the mutational spectrum in HIV populations in serum-from 33 mice we recovered 84,074 total reads comprising 31,290 unique sequence variants. We found enrichment of A-to-G transitions and deletions in envAS-treated mice, paralleling a previous tissue culture study where most target cells contained envAS, even though minority of cells were envAS-modified here. Unexpectedly, this enrichment was only detected after the challenge with HIV-1(BaL), where the viral genome would form an imperfect duplex with envAS, and not HIV-1(NL4-3), where a perfectly matched duplex would form.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) transcriptional transactivator (Tat) is essential for synthesis of full-length transcripts from the integrated viral genome by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Tat recruits the host positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to the HIV-1 promoter through binding to the transactivator RNA (TAR) at the 5'-end of the nascent HIV transcript. P-TEFb is a general Pol II transcription factor; its cellular activity is controlled by the 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and the HEXIM1 protein, which sequester P-TEFb into transcriptionally inactive 7SK/HEXIM/P-TEFb snRNP. Besides targeting P-TEFb to HIV transcription, Tat also increases the nuclear level of active P-TEFb through promoting its dissociation from the 7SK/HEXIM/P-TEFb RNP by an unclear mechanism. In this study, by using in vitro and in vivo RNA-protein binding assays, we demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat binds with high specificity and efficiency to an evolutionarily highly conserved stem-bulge-stem motif of the 5'-hairpin of human 7SK snRNA. The newly discovered Tat-binding motif of 7SK is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from the extensively characterized Tat-binding site of HIV TAR and importantly, it is imbedded in the HEXIM-binding elements of 7SK snRNA. We show that Tat efficiently replaces HEXIM1 on the 7SK snRNA in vivo and therefore, it promotes the disassembly of the 7SK/HEXIM/P-TEFb negative transcriptional regulatory snRNP to augment the nuclear level of active P-TEFb. This is the first demonstration that HIV-1 specifically targets an important cellular regulatory RNA, most probably to promote viral transcription and replication. Demonstration that the human 7SK snRNA carries a TAR RNA-like Tat-binding element that is essential for the normal transcriptional regulatory function of 7SK questions the viability of HIV therapeutic approaches based on small drugs blocking the Tat-binding site of HIV TAR.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 Study (GBD 2010 Study) began in the spring of 2007 and is the first major effort since the GBD 1990 Study to carry out a complete systematic assessment of the data on all diseases and injuries, producing comprehensive and comparable estimates of the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors for the years 1990, 2005, and 2010. This project has drawn upon the efforts of a multitude of people, including >800 condition-specific experts from around the world. The result has been the largest review of epidemiological data sources relevant to burden of disease. Conclusions: After a complete systematic assessment of the data on all diseases and injuries, we have expanded the number of data sources in our analysis significantly. GBD studies for 1990 and 2000 examined 108 diseases and causes in 8 regions and 170 diseases and causes in 14 regions, respectively. The GBD 2010 study expands the scope much further to >200 conditions and >40 risk factors in 21 individually distinct, but collectively comprehensive, global regions. At the same time, we have improved upon estimation methods significantly. Among the significant differences, we have: utilized population-level surveys to help derive health severity weights; used highly advanced published methods to establish mortality by age and sex; and radically improved the modeling techniques used for estimating incidence, prevalence, and causes of death. We have created new estimates for 1990 using these techniques and the widely expanded data available to us so that we can assess comparable time trends with the best possible science. In this presentation, I will highlight results from the GBD 2010 study, focusing on HIV/AIDS in the context of the other diseases and risk factors studied, to demonstrate this conditions’ global impact over the past two decades.},

  Abstract                 = {The Millennium Declaration in 2000 brought special global attention to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria through the formulation of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6. The Global Burden of Disease 2013 study provides a consistent and comprehensive approach to disease estimation for between 1990 and 2013, and an opportunity to assess whether accelerated progress has occured since the Millennium Declaration.To estimate incidence and mortality for HIV, we used the UNAIDS Spectrum model appropriately modified based on a systematic review of available studies of mortality with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART). For concentrated epidemics, we calibrated Spectrum models to fit vital registration data corrected for misclassification of HIV deaths. In generalised epidemics, we minimised a loss function to select epidemic curves most consistent with prevalence data and demographic data for all-cause mortality. We analysed counterfactual scenarios for HIV to assess years of life saved through prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and ART. For tuberculosis, we analysed vital registration and verbal autopsy data to estimate mortality using cause of death ensemble modelling. We analysed data for corrected case-notifications, expert opinions on the case-detection rate, prevalence surveys, and estimated cause-specific mortality using Bayesian meta-regression to generate consistent trends in all parameters. We analysed malaria mortality and incidence using an updated cause of death database, a systematic analysis of verbal autopsy validation studies for malaria, and recent studies (2010-13) of incidence, drug resistance, and coverage of insecticide-treated bednets.Globally in 2013, there were 1·8 million new HIV infections (95\% uncertainty interval 1·7 million to 2·1 million), 29·2 million prevalent HIV cases (28·1 to 31·7), and 1·3 million HIV deaths (1·3 to 1·5). At the peak of the epidemic in 2005, HIV caused 1·7 million deaths (1·6 million to 1·9 million). Concentrated epidemics in Latin America and eastern Europe are substantially smaller than previously estimated. Through interventions including PMTCT and ART, 19·1 million life-years (16·6 million to 21·5 million) have been saved, 70·3\% (65·4 to 76·1) in developing countries. From 2000 to 2011, the ratio of development assistance for health for HIV to years of life saved through intervention was US$4498 in developing countries. Including in HIV-positive individuals, all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·5 million (7·4 million to 7·7 million), prevalence was 11·9 million (11·6 million to 12·2 million), and number of deaths was 1·4 million (1·3 million to 1·5 million) in 2013. In the same year and in only individuals who were HIV-negative, all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·1 million (6·9 million to 7·3 million), prevalence was 11·2 million (10·8 million to 11·6 million), and number of deaths was 1·3 million (1·2 million to 1·4 million). Annualised rates of change (ARC) for incidence, prevalence, and death became negative after 2000. Tuberculosis in HIV-negative individuals disproportionately occurs in men and boys (versus women and girls); 64·0\% of cases (63·6 to 64·3) and 64·7\% of deaths (60·8 to 70·3). Globally, malaria cases and deaths grew rapidly from 1990 reaching a peak of 232 million cases (143 million to 387 million) in 2003 and 1·2 million deaths (1·1 million to 1·4 million) in 2004. Since 2004, child deaths from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa have decreased by 31·5\% (15·7 to 44·1). Outside of Africa, malaria mortality has been steadily decreasing since 1990.Our estimates of the number of people living with HIV are 18·7\% smaller than UNAIDS's estimates in 2012. The number of people living with malaria is larger than estimated by WHO. The number of people living with HIV, tuberculosis, or malaria have all decreased since 2000. At the global level, upward trends for malaria and HIV deaths have been reversed and declines in tuberculosis deaths have accelerated. 101 countries (74 of which are developing) still have increasing HIV incidence. Substantial progress since the Millennium Declaration is an encouraging sign of the effect of global action.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  Abstract                 = {Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) encodes a superantigen (Sag) that is required for efficient milk-borne transmission of virus from mothers to offspring. The mRNA used for Sag expression is controversial, and at least four different promoters (two in the long terminal repeat and two in the envelope gene) for sag mRNA have been reported. To determine which RNA is responsible for Sag function during milk-borne MMTV transmission, we mutated a splice donor site unique to a spliced sag RNA from the 5' envelope promoter. The splice donor mutation in an infectious provirus was transfected into XC cells and injected into BALB/c mice. Mice injected with wild-type provirus showed Sag activity by the deletion of Sag-specific T cells and induction of mammary tumors in 100\% of injected animals. However, mice injected with the splice donor mutant gave sporadic and delayed T-cell deletion and a low percentage of mammary tumors with a long latency, suggesting that the resulting tumors were due to the generation of recombinants with endogenous MMTVs. Third-litter offspring of mice injected with wild-type provirus showed Sag-specific T-cell deletion and developed mammary tumors with kinetics similar to those for mice infected by nursing on MMTV-infected mothers, whereas the third-litter offspring of the splice donor mutant-injected mice did not. One of the fifth-litter progeny of splice donor mutant-injected mice showed C3H Sag activity and had recombinants that repaired the splice donor mutation, thus confirming the necessity for the splice donor site for Sag function. These experiments are the first to show that the spliced sag mRNA from the 5' envelope promoter is required for efficient milk-borne transmission of C3H MMTV.},

  Abstract                 = {The Vpr protein of HIV-1 functions as a vital accessory gene by regulating various cellular functions, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-kappaB) suppression and cell-cycle arrest of the host cell. Several reports have indicated that Vpr complexes with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), but it remains unclear whether the GR pathway is required for Vpr to function. Here, we report that Vpr uses the GR pathway as a recruitment vehicle for the NF-kappaB co-activating protein, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). The GR interaction with Vpr is both necessary and sufficient to facilitate this interaction by potentiating the formation of a Vpr-GR-PARP-1 complex. The recruitment of PARP-1 by the Vpr-GR complex prevents its nuclear localization, which is necessary for Vpr to suppress NF-kappaB. The association of GR with PARP-1 is not observed with steroid (glucocorticoid) treatment, indicating that the GR association with PARP-1 is a gain of function that is solely attributed to HIV-1 Vpr. These data provide important insights into Vpr biology and its role in HIV pathogenesis.},

We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5\%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

A phylogenetic analysis based on 414nts of Gag gene sequences amplified by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed the distinct divergence of these variants compared to other published strains in a corresponding region. Significant predicted amino acid sequence variations were also identified in an immunorelevant region within this fragment which corresponded to a previously characterized cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitope cluster (EC2, aa 77-119). Furthermore, alignment of the predicted full-length Gag protein gene sequences of some of these variants associated with clinical cases of EIA in Canada with the published sequences of EIAV originating from other countries revealed conserved and variant sequences in regions corresponding to other characterized CTL epitope clusters, EC1, EC3 and EC4. Conserved sequences identified among different variant strains might have an important implication for their screening and selection of putative peptide epitopes to mediate relevant immune response and cross protection against divergent field strains of EIAV.},

  Abstract                 = {Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has contributed greatly toward survival for people with HIV, yet many remain undiagnosed until very late. Our aims were to estimate the life expectancy of an HIV-infected MSM living in a developed country with extensive access to ART and healthcare, and to assess the effect of late diagnosis on life expectancy.A stochastic computer simulation model of HIV infection and the effect of ART was used to estimate life expectancy and determine the distribution of potential lifetime outcomes of an MSM, aged 30 years, who becomes HIV positive in 2010. The effect of altering the diagnosis rate was investigated.Assuming a high rate of HIV diagnosis (median CD4 cell count at diagnosis, 432  cells/μl), projected median age at death (life expectancy) was 75.0 years. This implies 7.0 years of life were lost on average due to HIV. Cumulative risks of death by 5 and 10 years after infection were 2.3 and 5.2\%, respectively. The 95\% uncertainty bound for life expectancy was (68.0,77.3) years. When a low diagnosis rate was assumed (diagnosis only when symptomatic, median CD4 cell count 140  cells/μl), life expectancy was 71.5 years, implying an average 10.5 years of life lost due to HIV.If low rates of virologic failure observed in treated patients continue, predicted life expectancy is relatively high in people with HIV who can access a wide range of antiretrovirals. The greatest risk of excess mortality is due to delays in HIV diagnosis.},

Here, we review the latest literature on estimates of life expectancy and consider the implications for future research.With timely diagnosis, access to a variety of current drugs and good lifelong adherence, people with recently acquired infections can expect to have a life expectancy which is nearly the same as that of HIV-negative individuals. Modelling studies suggest that life expectancy could improve further if there were increased uptake of HIV testing, better antiretroviral regimens and treatment strategies, and the adoption of healthier lifestyles by those living with HIV. In particular, earlier diagnosis is one of the most important factors associated with better life expectancy. A consequence of improved survival is the increasing number of people with HIV who are aged over 50 years old, and further research into the impact of ageing on HIV-positive people will therefore become crucial. The development of age-specific HIV treatment and management guidelines is now called for.Analyses on cohort studies and mathematical modelling studies have been used to estimate life expectancy of those with HIV, providing useful insights of importance to individuals and healthcare planning.},

The reaction products of the enzymes localized in the basement membrane. Unlike the preparations of the fluorescent antibody technique, enzyme-labeled antibody preparations were permanent, could be observed with an ordinary microscope, and could be examined with the electron microscope. In the latter, specific localization of antibody occurred in the basement membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells known to synthesize basement membrane antigens. The method is sensitive because of the amplifying effect of the enzymatic activity. The ultrastructural preservation and localization were better with acid phosphatase-labeled antibody than with peroxidase-labeled antibody, but acid phosphatase conjugated antibody was unstable and difficult to prepare. Peroxidase-antibody conjugates were stable and could be stored for several months at 4 degrees C, or indefiniely in a frozen state.},

  Abstract                 = {Unlike other RNA tumor viruses, avian leukosis viruses (which cause lymphomas and occasionally other neoplasms) lack discrete "transforming genes". We have analyzed the virus-related DNA and RNA of avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced tumors in an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of ALV oncogenesis. Our results show that viral gene products are not required for maintenance of neoplastic transformation. Primary and metastatic tumors are clonal and thus presumably derived from a single infected cell. Most importantly, tumors from different birds have integration sites in common. Tumor cells synthesize discrete new poly(A) RNAs consisting of viral sequences covalently linked to cellular sequences. These RNA species are expressed at high levels in tumor cells. Our results suggest that in lymphoid tumors, an ALV provirus is integrated adjacent to a specific cellular gene, and the insertion of the viral promoter adjacent to this gene results in its enhanced expression, leading to neoplasia. These results have potentially important implications for the mechanism of non-viral carcinogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolutionary dynamics of HIV during the chronic phase of infection is driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively, the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to HIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution. Yet, little is known about the distribution of selection differentials between individual viruses and the impact of single polymorphisms on viral fitness. Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection coefficients from time series sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be rho = 1.4+/-0.6 x 10(-5) recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selection coefficients of at least 15\% of the observed non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8\% per generation. These results provide a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed studies will be possible as soon as data with higher time resolution and greater sample sizes are available.},

This antiviral activity can be constitutively expressed or induced by interferon-alpha, and it consists of protein-based tethers, which we term 'tetherins', that cause retention of fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces. Using deductive constraints and gene expression analyses, we identify CD317 (also called BST2 or HM1.24), a membrane protein of previously unknown function, as a tetherin. Specifically, CD317 expression correlated with, and induced, a requirement for Vpu during HIV-1 and murine leukaemia virus particle release. Furthermore, in cells where HIV-1 virion release requires Vpu expression, depletion of CD317 abolished this requirement. CD317 caused retention of virions on cell surfaces and, after endocytosis, in CD317-positive compartments. Vpu co-localized with CD317 and inhibited these effects. Inhibition of Vpu function and consequent mobilization of tetherin's antiviral activity is a potential therapeutic strategy in HIV/AIDS.},

  Abstract                 = {The retroviral phenomenon of superinfection resistance (SIR) defines an interference mechanism that is established after primary infection, preventing the infected cell from being superinfected by a similar type of virus. This review describes our present understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SIR established by three characteristic retroviruses: Murine Leukaemia Virus (MuLV), Foamy Virus (FV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In addition, SIR is discussed with respect to HIV superinfection of humans. MuLV resistant mice exhibit two genetic resistance traits related to SIR. The cellular Fv4 gene expresses an Env related protein that establishes resistance against MuLV infection. Another mouse gene (Fv1) mediates MuLV resistance by expression of a sequence that is distantly related to Gag and that blocks the viral infection after the reverse transcription step. FVs induce two distinct mechanisms of superinfection resistance. First, expression of the Env protein results in SIR, probably by occupancy of the cellular receptors for FV entry. Second, an increase in the concentration of the viral Bet (Between-env-and-LTR-1-and-2) protein reduces proviral FV gene expression by inhibition of the transcriptional activator protein Tas (Transactivator of spumaviruses). In contrast to SIR in FV and MuLV infection, the underlying mechanism of SIR in HIV-infected cells is poorly understood. CD4 receptor down-modulation, a major characteristic of HIV-infected cells, has been proposed to be the main mechanism of SIR against HIV, but data have been contradictory. Several recent studies report the occurrence of HIV superinfection in humans; an event associated with the generation of recombinant HIV strains and possibly with increased disease progression. The role of SIR in protecting patients from HIV superinfection has not been studied so far. The phenomenon of SIR may also be important in the protection of primates that are vaccinated with live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) against pathogenic SIV variants. As primate models of SIV infection closely resemble HIV infection, a better knowledge of SIR-induced mechanisms could contribute to the development of an HIV vaccine or other antiviral strategies.},

This strategy yielded >1 × 103 plaque-forming units (pfu) of virus per ml of supernatant at 48 hr posttransfection. The addition of plasmids expressing all of the remaining viral structural proteins led to a substantial increase in virus production, 3 × 104–5 × 107 pfu/ml. We also used reverse genetics to generate a reassortant virus containing the PB1 gene of the A/PR/8/34 virus, with all other genes representing A/WSN/33. Additional viruses produced by this method had mutations in the PA gene or possessed a foreign epitope in the head of the neuraminidase protein. This efficient system, which does not require helper virus infection, should be useful in viral mutagenesis studies and in the production of vaccines and gene therapy vectors.},

  Abstract                 = {Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target viral genes can efficiently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Nevertheless, there is the potential for viral escape, particularly with a highly mutable target such as HIV-1. We present a novel strategy for anticipating and preventing viral escape using second-generation siRNAs. The evolutionary capacity of HIV-1 was tested by exerting strong selective pressure on a highly conserved sequence in the HIV-1 genome. We assayed the antiviral efficacy of five overlapping siRNAs directed against an essential region of the HIV-1 protease. Serial viral transfers in U87-CD4-CXCR4 cells were performed using four of the siRNAs. This procedure was repeated until virus breakthrough was detected. After several serial culture passages, resistant virus with a single point mutation in the targeted region was detected in the culture supernatants. The emergence of resistant virus was confirmed by molecular cloning and DNA sequencing of viral RNA. The most common escape route was the D30N mutation. Importantly, the addition of a second-generation siRNA that matched the D30N mutation restored viral inhibition and delayed development of escape variants. Passages performed with both siRNAs prevented the emergence of the D30N escape mutant and forced the virus to develop new escape routes. Thus, second-generation siRNAs can be used to block escape from RNA interference (RNAi) and to search for new RNAi escape routes. The protocol described here may be useful for exploring the sequence space available for HIV-1 evolution and for producing attenuated or deleterious viruses.},

Although DNA sequencing costs have fallen markedly3, they remain far from what is necessary for rare and novel variants to be routinely identified at a genome-wide scale in large cohorts. We have therefore sought to develop second-generation methods for targeted sequencing of all protein-coding regions ('exomes'), to reduce costs while enriching for discovery of highly penetrant variants. Here we report on the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of the exomes of 12 humans. These include eight HapMap individuals representing three populations4, and four unrelated individuals with a rare dominantly inherited disorder, Freeman–Sheldon syndrome (FSS)5. We demonstrate the sensitive and specific identification of rare and common variants in over 300 megabases of coding sequence. Using FSS as a proof-of-concept, we show that candidate genes for Mendelian disorders can be identified by exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated, affected individuals. This strategy may be extendable to diseases with more complex genetics through larger sample sizes and appropriate weighting of non-synonymous variants by predicted functional impact.},

  Abstract                 = {Positive selection pressure acting on protein-coding sequences is usually inferred when the rate of nonsynonymous substitution is greater than the synonymous rate. However, purifying selection acting directly on the nucleotide sequence can lower the synonymous substitution rate. This could result in false inference of positive selection because when synonymous changes at some sites are under purifying selection, the average synonymous rate is an underestimate of the neutral rate of evolution. Even though HIV-1 coding sequences contain a number of regions that function at the nucleotide level, and are thus likely to be affected by purifying selection, studies of positive selection assume that synonymous substitutions can be used to estimate the neutral rate of evolution.We modelled site-to-site variation in the synonymous substitution rate across coding regions of the HIV-1 genome. Synonymous substitution rates were found to vary significantly within and between genes. Surprisingly, regions of the genome that encode proteins in more than one frame had significantly higher synonymous substitution rates than regions coding in a single frame. We found evidence of strong purifying selection pressure affecting synonymous mutations in fourteen regions with known functions. These included an exonic splicing enhancer, the rev-responsive element, the poly-purine tract and a transcription factor binding site. A further five highly conserved regions were located within known functional domains. We also found four conserved regions located in env and vpu which have not been characterized previously.We provide the coordinates of genomic regions with markedly lower synonymous substitution rates, which are putatively under the influence of strong purifying selection pressure at the nucleotide level as well as regions encoding proteins in more than one frame. These regions should be excluded from studies of positive selection acting on HIV-1 coding regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data is complicated by the intricate ascertainment schemes used to discover SNPs, and by the confounding influence of the underlying complex demographics and varying mutation and recombination rates. Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle SNP project and to Chromosome 2 data from the HapMap project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as DPP10 and COL4A3.},

In this study, we assessed the prevalence of group O viruses and other HIV-1 subtypes in Cameroon.A phylogenetic analysis of 18 HIV-1 strains isolated from seropositive individuals from Yaoundé and Douala, Cameroon.A 900 base-pair fragment of the env gene coding for V3, V4, V5, and the beginning of gp41 of 17 out of 18 HIV-1 isolates from Cameroon was amplified, cloned and sequenced using polymerase chain reaction. A phylogenetic tree was constructed.The overall env nucleotide sequence divergence among the Cameroon isolates ranged from 6.1 to 27.5\%. In a phylogenetic tree, six subtypes were identified when compared with 23 reference strains of different geographic origin. Of these 17 Cameroonian strains, 11 (61\%) were of subtype A of which the interpatient distances at the sequence level varied from 6.1\% to 18.3\% (average, 11.9\%). Three (17\%) strains were of subtype F, and the other three strains (6\% each) belonged to subtypes B, E and H, respectively. The remaining isolate was classified as belonging to group O, on the basis of the sequence of part of the pol gene. A very broad spectrum of different tetrameric amino-acid sequences was observed at the apex of the V3 loop. Eleven strains contained the tetrameric globally predominant GPGQ sequence at the tip of the V3 motif. Two strains had the GPGR sequence typical of the American and European HIV-1 strains. The remaining tetrameric sequences included GPGS, GSGQ, GRGQ, and GLGR.These findings on a limited number of viruses suggest extensive env gene diversity of HIV-1 strains from Cameroon, and could have implications for vaccine development in Africa.},

Layouts can naturally represent the cluster structure of graphs by grouping densely connected nodes and separating sparsely connected nodes. This article introduces two energy models whose minimum energy layouts represent the cluster structure, one based on repulsion between nodes (like most existing energy models) and one based on repulsion between edges. The latter model is not biased towards grouping nodes with high degrees, and is thus more appropriate for the many real-world graphs with right-skewed degree distributions. The two energy models are shown to be closely related to widely used quality criteria for graph clusterings – namely the density of the cut, Shi and Malik’s normalized cut, and Newman’s modularity – and to objective functions optimized by eigenvector-based graph drawing methods.},

The transition from G2 to mitosis is normally controlled by changes in the state of phosphorylation and subcellular compartmentalization of key cell-cycle regulatory proteins. In studies of the intracellular trafficking of these regulators, we unexpectedly found that wild-type Vpr, but not Vpr mutants impaired for G2 arrest, induced transient, localized herniations in the nuclear envelope (NE). These herniations were associated with defects in the nuclear lamina. Intermittently, these herniations ruptured, resulting in the mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components. These Vpr-induced NE changes probably contribute to the observed cell-cycle arrest.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a novel method, termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), that amplifies DNA with high specificity, efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions. This method employs a DNA polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA. An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target DNA initiates LAMP. The following strand displacement DNA synthesis primed by an outer primer releases a single-stranded DNA. This serves as template for DNA synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that hybridize to the other end of the target, which produces a stem-loop DNA structure. In subsequent LAMP cycling one inner primer hybridizes to the loop on the product and initiates displacement DNA synthesis, yielding the original stem-loop DNA and a new stem-loop DNA with a stem twice as long. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 10(9) copies of target in less than an hour. The final products are stem-loop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand. Because LAMP recognizes the target by six distinct sequences initially and by four distinct sequences afterwards, it is expected to amplify the target sequence with high selectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcription of HIV-1 genes depends on the RNA polymerase II kinase and elongation factor positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), the complex of cyclin T1 and CDK9. Recent evidence suggests that regulation of transcription by P-TEFb involves chromatin binding and modifying factors. To determine how P-TEFb may connect chromatin remodeling to transcription, we investigated the relationship between P-TEFb and histone H1. We identify histone H1 as a substrate for P-TEFb involved in cellular and HIV-1 transcription. We show that P-TEFb interacts with H1 and that P-TEFb inhibition by RNAi, flavopiridol, or dominant negative CDK9 expression correlates with loss of phosphorylation and mobility of H1 in vivo. Importantly, P-TEFb directs H1 phosphorylation in response to wild-type HIV-1 infection, but not Tat-mutant HIV-1 infection. Our results show that P-TEFb phosphorylates histone H1 at a specific C-terminal phosphorylation site. Expression of a mutant H1.1 that cannot be phosphorylated by P-TEFb also disrupts Tat transactivation in an HIV reporter cell line as well as transcription of the c-fos and hsp70 genes in HeLa cells. We identify histone H1 as a novel P-TEFb substrate, and our results suggest new roles for P-TEFb in both cellular and HIV-1 transcription.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome contains 20 exons that are alternatively spliced from 16 splice sites to generate more than 40 different mRNAs, including incompletely spliced and unspliced mRNAs. In contrast to avian retroviral RNA, which has a cis-acting element in gag that negatively regulates splicing (NRS), HIV-1 RNA did not have any NRS sequences in the gag or pol genes detectable by a splicing inhibition assay. However, this assay demonstrated that the HIV-1 first 5' splice site competed with a cellular 5' splice site, suggesting that HIV-1 may have some strong splice sites. To extend this observation, we used a splice site swapping strategy to determine the efficiency of 14 HIV-1 splice sites in human beta globin chimeras tested in transient transfection experiments. While the 1st HIV-1 5' splice site used in all spliced transcripts and the 4th 5' splice site used in most of the 2-kb transcripts were efficient, the other splice sites, including all the 3' splice sites, were less efficient, ranging in use from 25 to 60\%. We propose that this range of splice site efficiencies contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing of HIV-1 mRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: mRNA expression data from next generation sequencing platforms is obtained in the form of counts per gene or exon. Counts have classically been assumed to follow a Poisson distribution in which the variance is equal to the mean. The Negative Binomial distribution which allows for over-dispersion, i.e., for the variance to be greater than the mean, is commonly used to model count data as well. RESULTS: In mRNA-Seq data from 25 subjects, we found technical variation to generally follow a Poisson distribution as has been reported previously and biological variability was over-dispersed relative to the Poisson model. The mean-variance relationship across all genes was quadratic, in keeping with a Negative Binomial (NB) distribution. Over-dispersed Poisson and NB distributional assumptions demonstrated marked improvements in goodness-of-fit (GOF) over the standard Poisson model assumptions, but with evidence of over-fitting in some genes. Modeling of experimental effects improved GOF for high variance genes but increased the over-fitting problem. CONCLUSIONS: These conclusions will guide development of analytical strategies for accurate modeling of variance structure in these data and sample size determination which in turn will aid in the identification of true biological signals that inform our understanding of biological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome sequences of transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 have been inferred by analyzing single genome amplicons of acute infection plasma viral RNA in the context of a mathematical model of random virus evolution; however, few of these T/F sequences have been molecularly cloned and biologically characterized. Here, we describe the derivation and biological analysis of ten infectious molecular clones, each representing a T/F genome responsible for productive HIV-1 clade B clinical infection. Each of the T/F viruses primarily utilized the CCR5 coreceptor for entry and replicated efficiently in primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes. This result supports the conclusion that single genome amplification-derived sequences from acute infection allow for the inference of T/F viral genomes that are consistently replication competent. Studies with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) demonstrated various levels of replication among the T/F viruses. Although all T/F viruses replicated in MDM, the overall replication efficiency was significantly lower compared to prototypic "highly macrophage-tropic" virus strains. This phenotype was transferable by expressing the env genes in an isogenic proviral DNA backbone, indicating that T/F virus macrophage tropism mapped to Env. Furthermore, significantly higher concentrations of soluble CD4 were required to inhibit T/F virus infection compared to prototypic macrophage-tropic virus strains. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of clinical HIV-1 subtype B infection occurs by mucosal exposure to virus that is not highly macrophage tropic and that the generation and initial biological characterization of 10 clade B T/F infectious molecular clones provides new opportunities to probe virus-host interactions involved in HIV-1 transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide siRNA screens have identified host cell factors important for efficient HIV infection, among which are nuclear pore proteins such as RanBP2/Nup358 and the karyopherin Transportin-3/TNPO3. Analysis of the roles of these proteins in the HIV replication cycle suggested that correct trafficking through the pore may facilitate the subsequent integration step. Here we present data for coupling between these steps by demonstrating that depletion of Transportin-3 or RanBP2 altered the terminal step in early HIV replication, the selection of chromosomal sites for integration. We found that depletion of Transportin-3 and RanBP2 altered integration targeting for HIV. These knockdowns reduced HIV integration frequency in gene-dense regions and near gene-associated features, a pattern that differed from that reported for depletion of the HIV integrase binding cofactor Psip1/Ledgf/p75. MLV integration was not affected by the Transportin-3 knockdown. Using siRNA knockdowns and integration targeting analysis, we also implicated several additional nuclear proteins in proper target site selection. To map viral determinants of integration targeting, we analyzed a chimeric HIV derivative containing MLV gag, and found that the gag replacement phenocopied the Transportin-3 and RanBP2 knockdowns. Thus, our data support a model in which Gag-dependent engagement of the proper transport and nuclear pore machinery mediate trafficking of HIV complexes to sites of integration.},

Here, we used single-molecule amplification and long-read sequencing to study the HIV-1 provirus, which is only 9700 bp in length, but encodes nine major proteins via alternative splicing. Our data showed that the clinical isolate HIV-1(89.6) produces at least 109 different spliced RNAs, including a previously unappreciated ∼1 kb class of messages, two of which encode new proteins. HIV-1 message populations differed between cell types, longitudinally during infection, and among T cells from different human donors. These findings open a new window on a little studied aspect of HIV-1 replication, suggest therapeutic opportunities and provide advanced tools for the study of alternative splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {Diagnostic methods for detecting and quantifying HIV RNA have been improving, but efficient methods for point-of-care analysis are still needed, particularly for applications in resource-limited settings. Detection based on reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is particularly useful for this, because when combined with fluorescence-based DNA detection, RT-LAMP can be implemented with minimal equipment and expense. Assays have been developed to detect HIV RNA with RT-LAMP, but existing methods detect only a limited subset of HIV subtypes. Here we report a bioinformatic study to develop optimized primers, followed by empirical testing of 44 new primer designs. One primer set (ACeIN-26), targeting the HIV integrase coding region, consistently detected subtypes A, B, C, D, and G. The assay was sensitive to at least 5000 copies per reaction for subtypes A, B, C, D, and G, with Z-factors of above 0.69 (detection of the minor subtype F was found to be unreliable). There are already rapid and efficient assays available for detecting HIV infection in a binary yes/no format, but the rapid RT-LAMP assay described here has additional uses, including 1) tracking response to medication by comparing longitudinal values for a subject, 2) detecting of infection in neonates unimpeded by the presence of maternal antibody, and 3) detecting infection prior to seroconversion.},

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4718-4721]. It has been suggested that these recombinant molecules are a consequence of truncated extension products annealing to partially homologous templates on subsequent PCR cycles. However, we demonstrate here that recombinants can be generated during a single round of primer extension in the absence of subsequent heat denaturation, indicating that template-switching produces some of these recombinant molecules. Two types of template-switches were observed: (i) switches to pre-existing templates and (ii) switches to the complementary nascent strand. Recombination is reduced several fold when the complementary template strands are physically separated by attachment to streptavidin magnetic beads. This result supports the hypothesis that either the polymerase or at least one of the two extending strands switches templates during DNA synthesis and that interaction between the complementary template strands is necessary for efficient template-switching.},

  Abstract                 = {The split structure of most mammalian protein-coding genes allows for the potential to produce multiple different mRNA and protein isoforms from a single gene locus through the process of alternative splicing (AS). We propose a computational approach called UNCOVER based on a pair hidden Markov model to discover conserved coding exonic sequences subject to AS that have so far gone undetected. Applying UNCOVER to orthologous introns of known human and mouse genes predicts skipped exons or retained introns present in both species, while discriminating them from conserved noncoding sequences. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on a curated set of genes with known conserved AS events. The prediction of skipped exons in the approximately 1\% of the human genome represented by the ENCODE regions leads to more than 50 new exon candidates. Five novel predicted AS exons were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing analysis of 15 introns with strong UNCOVER predictions and lacking EST evidence. These results imply that a considerable number of conserved exonic sequences and associated isoforms are still completely missing from the current annotation of known genes. UNCOVER also identifies a small number of candidates for conserved intron retention.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing is a molecular mechanism by which different combinations of exons can be alternatively spliced to produce different mRNA isoforms. Recently, several databases have been published to predict the alternative splicing of mRNA; cancer-specific alternative splicing has also been predicted with these databases. Those variants may be potentially useful targets for cancer therapy, however, the accuracy and veracity of these databases have yet to be confirmed.In this study, we analyzed 17 genes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that were predicted to have cancer-specific alternative splicing by using the splicing database, the Alternative Splicing Annotation Project (ASAP) by Lee et al, between 38 cancer cell lines from various organs and 9 corresponding normal tissues. By designing 2 types of primer sets for RT-PCR including (1) primers flanking the alternatively spliced exons and (2) primers spanning the exon/exon junctions, cancer-associated splicing variants were investigated.The alternatively splicing events were detected in 15 of 17 genes (88\%); 35 of 43 variants (81\%) were detected successfully with RT-PCR. Among these variants, M-RIP, HYAL2, CDCA1, and MSMB genes showed differential expressions between cancer cell lines and corresponding normal tissues. Furthermore, RT-PCR with surgically resected gastric cancer tissues (diffuse type, 6; intestinal type, 4) confirmed that 2 variants of CDCA1 were upregulated in cancer tissues, whereas both variants of MSMB were expressed predominantly in normal tissues.Alternative splicing variants, especially in CDCA1, were detected in this study and may be potentially useful as diagnostic markers and/or novel targets for anticancer therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 to approximately 25-nucleotides (nt) long and interact with mRNAs to trigger either translational repression or RNA cleavage through RNA interference (RNAi), depending on the degree of complementarity with the target mRNAs. Our recent study has shown that HIV-1 nef dsRNA from AIDS patients who are long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) inhibited the transcription of HIV-1.Here, we show the possibility that nef-derived miRNAs are produced in HIV-1 persistently infected cells. Furthermore, nef short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that corresponded to a predicted nef miRNA (approximately 25 nt, miR-N367) can block HIV-1 Nef expression in vitro and the suppression by shRNA/miR-N367 would be related with low viremia in an LTNP (15-2-2). In the 15-2-2 model mice, the weight loss, which may be rendered by nef was also inhibited by shRNA/miR-N367 corresponding to suppression of nef expression in vivo.These data suggest that nef/U3 miRNAs produced in HIV-1-infected cells may suppress both Nef function and HIV-1 virulence through the RNAi pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) results from a combination of point mutations and genetic recombination, and rates of both processes are unusually high. This review focuses on the mechanisms and outcomes of HIV-1 genetic recombination and on the parameters that make recombination so remarkably frequent. Experimental work has demonstrated that the process that leads to recombination--a copy choice mechanism involving the migration of reverse transcriptase between viral RNA templates--occurs several times on average during every round of HIV-1 DNA synthesis. Key biological factors that lead to high recombination rates for all retroviruses are the recombination-prone nature of their reverse transcription machinery and their pseudodiploid RNA genomes. However, HIV-1 genes recombine even more frequently than do those of many other retroviruses. This reflects the way in which HIV-1 selects genomic RNAs for coencapsidation as well as cell-to-cell transmission properties that lead to unusually frequent associations between distinct viral genotypes. HIV-1 faces strong and changeable selective conditions during replication within patients. The mode of HIV-1 persistence as integrated proviruses and strong selection for defective proviruses in vivo provide conditions for archiving alleles, which can be resuscitated years after initial provirus establishment. Recombination can facilitate drug resistance and may allow superinfecting HIV-1 strains to evade preexisting immune responses, thus adding to challenges in vaccine development. These properties converge to provide HIV-1 with the means, motive, and opportunity to recombine its genetic material at an unprecedented high rate and to allow genetic recombination to serve as one of the highest barriers to HIV-1 eradication.},

In the present study, we found that HIV-1 infection of Jurkat T cells significantly induces the expression of miR-222. We show that this induction depends on HIV-1 Tat protein, which is able to increase the transcriptional activity of NFkB on miR-222 promoter. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-222 directly targets CD4, a key receptor for HIV-1, thus reducing its expression. We propose that Tat, by inducing miR-222 expression, complements the CD4 downregulation activity exerted by other viral proteins (i.e., Nef, Vpu, and Env), and we suggest that this represents a novel mechanism through which HIV-1 efficiently represses CD4 expression in infected cells.},

We detected substantial gene transfer in both individuals' neutrophils that lead to a large number of functionally corrected phagocytes and notable clinical improvement. Large-scale retroviral integration site-distribution analysis showed activating insertions in MDS1-EVI1, PRDM16 or SETBP1 that had influenced regulation of long-term hematopoiesis by expanding gene-corrected myelopoiesis three- to four-fold in both individuals. Although insertional influences have probably reinforced the therapeutic efficacy in this trial, our results suggest that gene therapy in combination with bone marrow conditioning can be successfully used to treat inherited diseases affecting the myeloid compartment such as CGD.},

  Abstract                 = {By means of a selective DNA amplification technique called polymerase chain reaction, proviral sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) were identified directly in DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of persons seropositive but not in DNA isolated from PBMCs of persons seronegative for the virus. Primer pairs from multiple regions of the HIV-1 genome were used to achieve maximum sensitivity of provirus detection. HIV-1 sequences were detected in 100\% of DNA specimens from seropositive, homosexual men from whom the virus was isolated by coculture, but in none of the DNA specimens from a control group of seronegative, virus culture-negative persons. However, HIV-1 sequences were detected in 64\% of DNA specimens from seropositive, virus culture-negative homosexual men. This method of DNA amplification made it possible to obtain results within 3 days, whereas virus isolation takes up to 3 to 4 weeks. The method may therefore be used to complement or replace virus isolation as a routine means of determining HIV-1 infection.},

  Abstract                 = {The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and RNA silencing pathways is complex and multifaceted. Essential for efficient viral transcription and supporting Tat-mediated transactivation of viral gene expression, the trans-activation responsive (TAR) element is a structured RNA located at the 5' end of all transcripts derived from HIV-1. Here, we report that this element is a source of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cultured HIV-1-infected cell lines and in HIV-1-infected human CD4+ T lymphocytes. Using primer extension and ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays, we delineated both strands of the TAR miRNA duplex deriving from a model HIV-1 transcript, namely miR-TAR-5p and miR-TAR-3p. In vitro RNase assays indicate that the lack of a free 3' extremity at the base of TAR may contribute to its low processing reactivity in vivo. Both miR-TAR-5p and miR-TAR-3p down-regulated TAR miRNA sensor activity in a process that required an integral miRNA-guided RNA silencing machinery. miR-TAR-3p exerted superior gene downregulatory effects, probably due to its preferential release from HIV-1 TAR RNA by the RNase III Dicer. Our study suggests that the TAR element of HIV-1 transcripts releases functionally competent miRNAs upon asymmetrical processing by Dicer, thereby providing novel insights into viral miRNA biogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate profiling of minute quantities of RNA in a global manner can enable key advances in many scientific and clinical disciplines. Here, we present low-quantity RNA sequencing (LQ-RNAseq), a high-throughput sequencing-based technique allowing whole transcriptome surveys from subnanogram RNA quantities in an amplification/ligation-free manner. LQ-RNAseq involves first-strand cDNA synthesis from RNA templates, followed by 3' polyA tailing of the single-stranded cDNA products and direct single molecule sequencing. We applied LQ-RNAseq to profile S. cerevisiae polyA+ transcripts, demonstrate the reproducibility of the approach across different sample preparations and independent instrument runs, and establish the absolute quantitative power of this method through comparisons with other reported transcript profiling techniques and through utilization of RNA spike-in experiments. We demonstrate the practical application of this approach to define the transcriptional landscape of mouse embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, observing transcriptional differences, including over 100 genes exhibiting differential expression between these otherwise very similar stem cell populations. This amplification-independent technology, which utilizes small quantities of nucleic acid and provides quantitative measurements of cellular transcripts, enables global gene expression measurements from minute amounts of materials and offers broad utility in both basic research and translational biology for characterization of rare cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Our understanding of human biology and disease is ultimately dependent on a complete understanding of the genome and its functions. The recent application of microarray and sequencing technologies to transcriptomics has changed the simplistic view of transcriptomes to a more complicated view of genome-wide transcription where a large fraction of transcripts emanates from unannotated parts of genomes, and underlined our limited knowledge of the dynamic state of transcription. Most of this broad body of knowledge was obtained indirectly because current transcriptome analysis methods typically require RNA to be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) before measurements, even though the cDNA synthesis step introduces multiple biases and artefacts that interfere with both the proper characterization and quantification of transcripts. Furthermore, cDNA synthesis is not particularly suitable for the analysis of short, degraded and/or small quantity RNA samples. Here we report direct single molecule RNA sequencing without prior conversion of RNA to cDNA. We applied this technology to sequence femtomole quantities of poly(A)(+) Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA using a surface coated with poly(dT) oligonucleotides to capture the RNAs at their natural poly(A) tails and initiate sequencing by synthesis. We observed transcript 3' end heterogeneity and polyadenylated small nucleolar RNAs. This study provides a path to high-throughput and low-cost direct RNA sequencing and achieving the ultimate goal of a comprehensive and bias-free understanding of transcriptomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Pairs of templates and primers were designed so that only recombination events would lead to amplification via the polymerase chain reaction. This approach reveals that lesions such as breaks, apurinic sites, and UV damage in a DNA template can cause the extending primer to jump to another template during the polymerase chain reaction. By comparing sequences of amplification products that were determined directly or via bacterial cloning, it was shown that when the thermostable Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase encounters the end of a template molecule, it sometimes inserts an adenosine residue; the prematurely terminated product then jumps to another template and polymerization continues, creating an in vitro recombination product. Consequently, amplification products from damaged templates such as archaeological DNA are made up of a high proportion of chimeric molecules. The illegitimate adenosine and thymidine residues in these molecules are detected when cloned molecules are sequenced, but are generally averaged out when the amplification product is sequenced directly. However, if site-specific lesions exist in template DNA or if the amplification is initiated from very few copies, direct sequencing also may yield incorrect sequences. The phenomenon of the "jumping polymerase chain reaction" can be exploited to assess the frequency and location of lesions in nucleic acids.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in treating individuals infected with HIV, HAART is not a cure. A latent reservoir, composed mainly of resting CD4+T cells, drives viral rebound once therapy is stopped. Understanding the formation and maintenance of latently infected cells could provide clues to eradicating this reservoir. However, there have been discrepancies regarding the susceptibility of resting cells to HIV infection in vitro and in vivo. As we have previously shown that resting CD4+T cells are susceptible to HIV integration, we asked whether these cells were capable of producing viral proteins and if so, why resting cells were incapable of supporting productive infection. To answer this question, we spinoculated resting CD4+T cells with or without prior stimulation, and measured integration, transcription, and translation of viral proteins. We found that resting cells were capable of producing HIV Gag without supporting spreading infection. This block corresponded with low HIV envelope levels both at the level of protein and RNA and was not an artifact of spinoculation. The defect was reversed upon stimulation with IL-7 or CD3/28 beads. Thus, a population of latent cells can produce viral proteins without resulting in spreading infection. These results have implications for therapies targeting the latent reservoir and suggest that some latent cells could be cleared by a robust immune response.},

However, the conflict between ensuring splicing efficiency and preserving the coding capacity for an optimal protein during evolution has not been specifically analyzed. In fact, studies on genomic variability in fields as diverse as clinical genetics and molecular evolution mainly focus on the effect of mutations on protein function. Synonymous variations, in particular, are assumed to be functionally neutral both in clinical diagnosis and when measuring evolutionary distances between species. Using the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 12 splicing as a model, we have established that about one quarter of synonymous variations result in exon skipping and, hence, in an inactive CFTR protein. Furthermore, comparative splicing evaluation of mammalian sequence divergences showed that artificial combinations of CFTR exon 12 synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions are incompatible with normal RNA processing. In particular, the combination of the mouse synonymous with the human missense variations causes exon skipping. It follows that there are two sequential levels at which evolutionary selection of genomic variants take place: splicing control and protein function optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), a contagious lung cancer of sheep. Until recently, research on JSRV/OPA was hampered by the lack of a tissue culture system for the propagation of the virus. Historically, pathological samples (lung fluid) collected from sheep affected by OPA were the only source of infectious JSRV. Thus studies on the JSRV/OPA system were conducted only where field isolates of OPA cases were readily available. In the past 10 years, the deduction of the JSRV sequence (York et al. 1991; York 1992), the isolation of an infectious and oncogenic JSRV molecular clone (JSRV21) (Palmarini et al. 1999a) and the establishment of a rapid method to produce infectious virus in vitro (Palmarini et al. 1999a) sparked many studies at the molecular level that strengthened past observations and revealed new properties of this unique virus. Here, we will review the data accumulated so far on the molecular biology of JSRV using the infectious and oncogenic JSRV21 molecular clone as virus of reference.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies demonstrate that suppressive therapy can drive HIV-1 RNA levels to less than 50 copies mL(-1) in patient plasma. Yet, ultrasensitive assays show that most patients continue to harbour low-level persistent viremia. Treatment intensification studies indicate that low-level viremia could arise from several different sources. These sources include: (i) long-lived HIV-infected cells that replicate and produce virus; (ii) ongoing replication cycles in cells located in sanctuary sites where drug levels are suboptimal; and/or (iii) proliferation of latently infected cells with regeneration of a stable reservoir of slowly dividing infected cells. A well-defined latent reservoir of HIV is memory CD4+ T-cells where latency is established when an activated CD4+ T-cell becomes infected by HIV, but transitions to a terminally differentiated memory cell before it is eliminated. This review examines the dynamics and possible reservoirs of persistent HIV in patients on suppressive therapy, the mechanisms promoting viral latency and strategies to purge latent viral reservoirs. The promising research described here takes a number of steps forward to seriously address HIV remission and/or eradication.},

These species-specific AS events are predicted to modify conserved domains in proteins more frequently than other classes of AS events. The results thus provide evidence that species-specific AS of conserved exons constitutes an additional potential source of complexity and species-specific differences between mammals.},

Using AS microarrays, we show that PTC-containing splice variants are generally produced at uniformly low levels across diverse mammalian cells and tissues, independently of the action of NMD. Our results suggest that most PTC-introducing AS events are not under positive selection pressure and therefore may not contribute important functional roles.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Alu RNAs are present at elevated levels in stress conditions and, consequently, Alu repeats are increasingly being associated with the physiological stress response. Alu repeats are known to harbor transcription factor binding sites that modulate RNA pol II transcription and Alu RNAs act as transcriptional co-repressors through pol II binding in the promoter regions of heat shock responsive genes. An observation of a putative HSF binding site in Alu led us to explore whether, through HSF binding, these elements could further contribute to the heat shock response repertoire. RESULTS: Alu density was significantly enriched in transcripts that are down-regulated following heat shock recovery in HeLa cells. ChIP analysis confirmed HSF binding to a consensus motif exhibiting positional conservation across various Alu sub-families, and reporter constructs demonstrated a sequence-specific two-fold induction of these sites in response to heat shock. These motifs were over-represented in the genic regions of down-regulated transcripts in antisense oriented Alus. Affymetrix Exon arrays detected antisense signals in a significant fraction of the down-regulated transcripts, 50\% of which harbored HSF sites within 5kb. siRNA knockdown of the selected antisense transcripts led to the over-expression, following heat shock, of their corresponding down-regulated transcripts. The antisense transcripts were significantly enriched in processes related to RNA pol III transcription and the TFIIIC complex. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a non-random presence of Alu repeats harboring HSF sites in heat shock responsive transcripts. This presence underlies an antisense mediated mechanism that represents a novel component of Alu and HSF involvement in the heat shock response.},

  Abstract                 = {In metazoan organisms, pre-mRNA splicing is thought to occur during transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally coupled via still-unknown mechanisms. Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis. Here we isolate nascent chromatin-associated RNA from free, nucleoplasmic RNA already released from the DNA template. Using a quantitative RT-PCR assay, we show that the majority of introns separating constitutive exons are already excised from the human c-Src and fibronectin pre-mRNAs that are still in the process of synthesis, and that these introns are removed in a general 5'-to-3' order. Introns flanking alternative exons in these transcripts are also removed during synthesis, but show differences in excision efficiency between cell lines with different regulatory conditions. Our data suggest that skipping of an exon can induce a lag in splicing compared to intron removal under conditions of exon inclusion. Nevertheless, excision of the long intron encompassing the skipped exon is still completed prior to transcript release into the nucleoplasm. Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally.},

As a means of determining whether both of these RNA's are used in the reverse transcription reaction, cells were infected with heterozygous virus particles that varied in nucleotide sequence at two separate locations at the RNA termini. The DNA proviruses formed from a single cycle of reverse transcription were then examined. Of the 12 proviruses that were characterized, all exhibited long terminal repeats (LTR's) that would be expected to arise only if both RNA templates were used for the generation of minus strand DNA. In contrast, only a single minus strand DNA appeared to be used as template for the plus strand DNA in the generation of fully double-stranded viral DNA. These results indicate that the first strand transfer step in reverse transcription is an intermolecular event while that of the second transfer is intramolecular. Thus, retroviruses contain two functionally active RNA's, and both may be required for the generation of a single linear DNA molecule. Formation of heterozygotes during retrovirus infection would be expected to result in the efficient generation of LTR recombinants.},

Transfection with one of these DNAs resulted in the generation of mutant virus incapable of integrating but able to replicate at low levels; this phenotype is identical to that of mutants bearing alterations in the cis-acting region, att. To determine whether the 3' end of the pol gene encodes a protein that interacts with att, we did a complementation experiment. Cells were first infected with an att- virus and then superinfected with the integration-deficient virus containing a lesion in the pol gene and a wild-type att site. The results showed that the att- virus provided a transacting function allowing integration of viral DNA derived from the mutant bearing a wild-type att site. Thus, the 3' end of the pol gene serves as an "int" locus and encodes a protein mediating integration of retrovirus DNA through interaction with att.},

  Abstract                 = {Stigma, discrimination, lack of privacy, and long waiting times partly explain why six out of ten individuals living with HIV do not access facility-based testing. By circumventing these barriers, self-testing offers potential for more people to know their sero-status. Recent approval of an in-home HIV self test in the US has sparked self-testing initiatives, yet data on acceptability, feasibility, and linkages to care are limited. We systematically reviewed evidence on supervised (self-testing and counselling aided by a health care professional) and unsupervised (performed by self-tester with access to phone/internet counselling) self-testing strategies.Seven databases (Medline [via PubMed], Biosis, PsycINFO, Cinahl, African Medicus, LILACS, and EMBASE) and conference abstracts of six major HIV/sexually transmitted infections conferences were searched from 1st January 2000-30th October 2012. 1,221 citations were identified and 21 studies included for review. Seven studies evaluated an unsupervised strategy and 14 evaluated a supervised strategy. For both strategies, data on acceptability (range: 74\%-96\%), preference (range: 61\%-91\%), and partner self-testing (range: 80\%-97\%) were high. A high specificity (range: 99.8\%-100\%) was observed for both strategies, while a lower sensitivity was reported in the unsupervised (range: 92.9\%-100\%; one study) versus supervised (range: 97.4\%-97.9\%; three studies) strategy. Regarding feasibility of linkage to counselling and care, 96\% (n = 102/106) of individuals testing positive for HIV stated they would seek post-test counselling (unsupervised strategy, one study). No extreme adverse events were noted. The majority of data (n = 11,019/12,402 individuals, 89\%) were from high-income settings and 71\% (n = 15/21) of studies were cross-sectional in design, thus limiting our analysis.Both supervised and unsupervised testing strategies were highly acceptable, preferred, and more likely to result in partner self-testing. However, no studies evaluated post-test linkage with counselling and treatment outcomes and reporting quality was poor. Thus, controlled trials of high quality from diverse settings are warranted to confirm and extend these findings. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

Here we describe a strategy to genetically modify human iPS cells at 'safe harbor' sites in the genome, which fulfill five criteria based on their position relative to contiguous coding genes, microRNAs and ultraconserved regions. We demonstrate that ∼10\% of integrations of a lentivirally encoded β-globin transgene in β-thalassemia-patient iPS cell clones meet our safe harbor criteria and permit high-level β-globin expression upon erythroid differentiation without perturbation of neighboring gene expression. This approach, combining bioinformatics and functional analyses, should be broadly applicable to introducing therapeutic or suicide genes into patient-specific iPS cells for use in cell therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {A central goal in molecular evolution is to understand how genetic interactions between protein mutations shape protein function and fitness. While intergenic epistasis has been extensively explored in eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses, intragenic epistatic interactions have been insufficiently studied. Here, we employ a model system in which lambda phage fitness correlates with the enzymatic activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease to systematically determine the epistatic interactions between intragenic pairs of deleterious protein substitutions. We generated 114 genotypes of the HIV-1 protease, each carrying pairs of nucleotide substitution mutations whose separated and combined deleterious effects on fitness were then determined. A high proportion (39\%) of pairs displayed lethality. Several pairs exhibited significant interactions for fitness, including positive and negative epistasis. Significant negative epistatic interactions predominated (15\%) over positive interactions (2\%). However, the average+/-SD epistatic effect, ē=0.0025+/-0.1334, was not significantly different from zero (p=0.8368). Notably, epistatic interactions, regardless of epistatic direction, tend to be more frequent in the context of less deleterious mutations. In the present study, the high frequencies of lethality and negative epistasis indicate that the HIV-1 protease is highly sensitive to the effects of deleterious mutations. Therefore, proteins may not be as robust to mutational change as is usually expected.},

  Abstract                 = {Defining the virus-host interactions responsible for HIV-1 transmission, including the phenotypic requirements of viruses capable of establishing de novo infections, could be important for AIDS vaccine development. Previous analyses have failed to identify phenotypic properties other than chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4+ T-cell tropism that are preferentially associated with viral transmission. However, most of these studies were limited to examining envelope (Env) function in the context of pseudoviruses. Here, we generated infectious molecular clones of transmitted founder (TF; n = 27) and chronic control (CC; n = 14) viruses of subtypes B (n = 18) and C (n = 23) and compared their phenotypic properties in assays specifically designed to probe the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found that TF virions were 1.7-fold more infectious (P = 0.049) and contained 1.9-fold more Env per particle (P = 0.048) compared with CC viruses. TF viruses were also captured by monocyte-derived dendritic cells 1.7-fold more efficiently (P = 0.035) and more readily transferred to CD4+ T cells (P = 0.025). In primary CD4+ T cells, TF and CC viruses replicated with comparable kinetics; however, when propagated in the presence of IFN-α, TF viruses replicated to higher titers than CC viruses. This difference was significant for subtype B (P = 0.000013) but not subtype C (P = 0.53) viruses, possibly reflecting demographic differences of the respective patient cohorts. Together, these data indicate that TF viruses are enriched for higher Env content, enhanced cell-free infectivity, improved dendritic cell interaction, and relative IFN-α resistance. These viral properties, which likely act in concert, should be considered in the development and testing of AIDS vaccines.},

To study this, we engineered Molt3, a T cell progenitor T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, using lentiviral IL-7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) to serve as a model system. IL-7 promoted pre-TCR activation in IL-7Rα(hi) Molt3 as illustrated by CD25 up-regulation after anti-CD3 stimulation. Anti-CD3 treatment activated Akt and Erk1/2 signaling pathways as proven using specific inhibitors, and IL-7 further enhanced both signaling pathways. The close association of IL-7Rα with CD3ζ in the pre-TCR complex was illustrated through live imaging confocal fluorescence microscopy. These results demonstrate a direct and cooperative role of IL-7 in pre-TCR signaling.},

  Abstract                 = {The product of the vpr open reading frame of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a 15-kDa, arginine-rich protein that is present in virions in molar quantities equivalent to that of Gag. We report here the results of our investigations into the mechanism by which Vpr is incorporated into virions during assembly in infected cells. For these studies we used an expression vector encoding a Vpr molecule fused at its amino terminus to a nine-amino-acid peptide from influenza virus hemagglutinin. The tagged Vpr expression vector and a vpr mutant HIV-1 provirus were used to cotransfect COS cells, and the resulting virions were tested for the presence of the tagged protein on immunoblots probed with monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin peptide. The COS-produced virions were found to contain readily detectable amounts of tagged Vpr and smaller amounts of a putative tagged Vpr dimer. Infectivity of the particles was not altered by incorporation of tagged Vpr. Our results using this system in combination with mutant HIV-1 proviruses suggested that incorporation of Vpr into virions requires the carboxy-terminal Gag protein of HIV-1 (p6) but not gp160, Pol, or genomic viral RNA. In addition, analysis of mutated, tagged Vpr molecules suggested that amino acids near the carboxy terminus (amino acids 84 to 94) are required for incorporation of Vpr into HIV-1 virions. The single cysteine residue near the carboxy terminus was required for production of a stable protein. Arginine residues tested were not important for incorporation or stability of tagged Vpr. These results suggested a novel strategy for blocking HIV-1 replication.},

The clones were recovered from fetal equine kidney (FEK) cells infected with a virulent, cell culture-adapted virus stock (designated PV) and have been characterized at a molecular level. Each clone has unique envelope and long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. We further investigated LTR sequence variation in the PV stock using PCR amplification to obtain additional LTR clones from infected FEK cells and from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from animals experimentally infected with PV. Sequence analysis of resulting clones indicates a selection for different LTR populations in pony PBMCs compared to FEK cells. Finally, we observed that the cloned EIAV proviruses did not remain infectious when maintained in a derivative of pBR322. However, two proviruses have been stably maintained in a low copy number vector (pLG338-SPORT).},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular mechanisms utilized by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to enter latency are poorly understood. Following the infection of Jurkat T cells with lentiviral vectors that express Tat in cis, gene expression is progressively silenced. Silencing is greatly enhanced when the lentiviral vectors carry an attenuated Tat gene with the H13L mutation. Individual clones of lentivirus-infected cells showed a wide range of shutdown rates, with the majority showing a 50\% silencing frequency between 30 to 80 days. The silenced clones characteristically contained a small fraction (0 to 15\%) of activated cells that continued to express d2EGFP. When d2EGFP(+) and d2EGFP(-) cell populations were isolated from the shutdown clones, they quickly reverted to the original distribution of inactive and active cells, suggesting that the d2EGFP(+) cells arise from stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. The detailed analysis of transcription initiation and elongation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirms that Tat levels are restricted in the latently infected cells but gradually rise during proviral reactivation. ChIP assays using clones of latently infected cells demonstrate that the latent proviruses carry high levels of deacetylated histones and trimethylated histones. In contrast, the cellular genes IkappaB alpha and GAPDH had high levels of acetylated histones and no trimethylated histones. The levels of trimethylated histone H3 and HP1-alpha associated with HIV proviruses fell rapidly after tumor necrosis factor alpha activation. The progressive shutdown of HIV transcription following infection suggests that epigenetic mechanisms targeting chromatin structures selectively restrict HIV transcription initiation. This decreases Tat production below the levels that are required to sustain HIV gene expression.},

All three sequences were found to code for infectious viruses. Both the host range and the kinetics of infection in CD4+ cells were different for the three viruses. Virus derived from each molecular clone was infectious on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), although LAI and ELI displayed more rapid growth kinetics than MAL. The viruses had different tropisms and growth kinetics in six cell lines. LAI was infectious in all of the cell lines and produced high levels of reverse transcriptase activity. MAL and ELI had more restricted tropisms: MAL could only replicate on SupT1, whereas ELI grew on Jurkat and MT-4, was delayed on CEM and H9, and was unable to infect U937 cells. In addition, we observed that both the replicative capacity and the cell tropism of viruses could change after passage through some established cell lines. These results suggest that the genotypes of some viruses in vitro are not stable and that selection for growth can cause the fairly rapid appearance of variants with increased growth potential.},

The major gag protein of SIVcpz migrated on SDS-PAGE with a relative molecular mass of 25.5 and the outer membrane proteins were 110, 155 and 185 kD, respectively. SIVcpz did not induce severe cytopathic effects in human and chimpanzee lymphocytes. Antigenically, SIVcpz seems to be closer to HIV-1 than to HIV-2 and the other SIVs.

Here we introduce a memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the overall memory requirements for de novo assembly of metagenomes. On one soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of the host response to virus infection typically focus on protein-coding genes. However, non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcribed in mammalian cells, and the roles of many of these ncRNAs remain enigmas. Using next-generation sequencing, we performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross. We observed differential expression of approximately 500 annotated, long ncRNAs and 1,000 nonannotated genomic regions during infection. Moreover, studies of a subset of these ncRNAs and genomic regions showed the following. (i) Most were similarly regulated in response to influenza virus infection. (ii) They had distinctive kinetic expression profiles in type I interferon receptor and STAT1 knockout mice during SARS-CoV infection, including unique signatures of ncRNA expression associated with lethal infection. (iii) Over 40\% were similarly regulated in vitro in response to both influenza virus infection and interferon treatment. These findings represent the first discovery of the widespread differential expression of long ncRNAs in response to virus infection and suggest that ncRNAs are involved in regulating the host response, including innate immunity. At the same time, virus infection models provide a unique platform for studying the biology and regulation of ncRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyadenylated mature mRNAs are the focus of standard transcriptome analyses. However, the profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here, we separately sequenced total RNAs (Total RNAseq) and mRNAs (mRNAseq) from the same HIV-1-infected human CD4(+) T cells. We found that many nonpolyadenylated RNAs were differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, and we identified 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 h postinfection by Total RNAseq than by mRNAseq. These expression changes were also evident by concurrent changes in introns and were recapitulated by later mRNA changes, revealing an unexpectedly significant delay between transcriptional initiation and mature mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. We computationally derived and validated the underlying regulatory programs, and we predicted drugs capable of reversing these HIV-1-induced expression changes followed by experimental confirmation. Our results show that combined total and mRNA transcriptome analysis is essential for fully capturing the early host response to virus infection and provide a framework for identifying candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS.In this study, we used mass sequencing to identify genes differentially expressed in CD4(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection. To our surprise, we found many differentially expressed genes early after infection by analyzing both newly transcribed unprocessed pre-mRNAs and fully processed mRNAs, but not by analyzing mRNAs alone, indicating a significant delay between transcription initiation and mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. These results also show that important findings could be missed by the standard practice of analyzing mRNAs alone. We then derived the regulatory mechanisms driving the observed expression changes using integrative computational analyses. Further, we predicted drugs that could reverse the observed expression changes induced by HIV-1 infection and showed that one of the predicted drugs indeed potently inhibited HIV-1 infection. This shows that it is possible to identify candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS using our genomics-based approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of changes in viral load after initiation of treatment with potent antiretroviral agents has provided substantial insight into the dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The concentration of HIV-1 in plasma drops by approximately 99\% in the first two weeks of treatment owing to the rapid elimination of free virus with a half-life (t1/2) of < or =6 hours and loss of productively infected cells with a t1/2 of 1.6 days. Here we show that with combination therapy this initial decrease is followed by a slower second-phase decay of plasma viraemia. Detailed mathematical analysis shows that the loss of long-lived infected cells (t1/2 of 1-4 weeks) is a major contributor to the second phase, whereas the activation of latently infected lymphocytes (t1/2 of 0.5-2 weeks) is only a minor source. Based on these decay characteristics, we estimate that 2.3-3.1 years of a completely inhibitory treatment would be required to eliminate HIV-1 from these compartments. To eradicate HIV-1 completely, even longer treatment may be needed because of the possible existence of undetected viral compartments or sanctuary sites.},

Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t 1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t 1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies.},

We generated an HIV-resistant genotype de novo using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) to disrupt endogenous CCR5. Transient expression of CCR5 ZFNs permanently and specifically disrupted approx50% of CCR5 alleles in a pool of primary human CD4+ T cells. Genetic disruption of CCR5 provided robust, stable and heritable protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro and in vivo in a NOG model of HIV infection. HIV-1-infected mice engrafted with ZFN-modified CD4+ T cells had lower viral loads and higher CD4+ T-cell counts than mice engrafted with wild-type CD4+ T cells, consistent with the potential to reconstitute immune function in individuals with HIV/AIDS by maintenance of an HIV-resistant CD4+ T-cell population. Thus adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded CCR5 ZFN–modified autologous CD4+ T cells in HIV patients is an attractive approach for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.},

Here, we present a method to generate clean genome-wide transcriptome profiles, using actinomycin D (ActD) during reverse transcription. We show that antisense artifacts appear to be triggered by spurious synthesis of second-strand cDNA during reverse transcription reactions. Strand-specific hybridization signals obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae tiling arrays were compared between samples prepared with and without ActD. Use of ActD removed about half of the detectable antisense transcripts, consistent with their being artifacts, while sense expression levels and about 200 antisense transcripts were not affected. Our findings thus facilitate a more accurate assessment of the extent and position of antisense transcription, towards a better understanding of its role in cells.},

MSRV has been isolated repeatedly from leptomeningeal, choroid plexus and from Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells of MS patients. A strategy based on reverse transcriptase PCR with RNA-purified extracellular virions yielded an initial pol fragment from which other regions of the retroviral genome were subsequently obtained by sequence extension. MSRV-specific PCR primers amplified a pol region from RNA present at the peak of reverse transcriptase activity, coinciding with extracellular viral particles in sucrose density gradients. The same sequence was detected in noncellular RNA from MS patient plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid from untreated MS patients. MSRV is related to, but distinct from, the endogenous retroviral sequence ERV9. Whether MSRV represents an exogenous retrovirus with closely related endogenous elements or a replication-competent, virion-producing, endogenous provirus is as yet unknown. Further molecular epidemiological studies are required to determine precisely the apparent association of virions containing MSRV RNA with MS.},

  Abstract                 = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4), a member of the human herpesvirus (HHV) family, has recently been shown to encode microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast to most eukaryotic miRNAs, these viral miRNAs do not have close homologs in other viral genomes or in the genome of the human host. To identify other miRNA genes in pathogenic viruses, we combined a new miRNA gene prediction method with small-RNA cloning from several virus-infected cell types. We cloned ten miRNAs in the Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV or HHV8), nine miRNAs in the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and nine miRNAs in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV5). These miRNA genes are expressed individually or in clusters from either polymerase (pol) II or pol III promoters, and share no substantial sequence homology with one another or with the known human miRNAs. Generally, we predicted miRNAs in several large DNA viruses, and we could neither predict nor experimentally identify miRNAs in the genomes of small RNA viruses or retroviruses.},

  Abstract                 = {Ribavirin is a nucleotide analog that can be incorporated by viral polymerases, causing mutations by allowing base mismatches. It is currently used therapeutically as an antiviral drug during hepatitis C virus infections. During the amplification of poliovirus genomic RNA or hepatitis C replicons, error frequency is known to increase upon ribavirin treatment. This observation has led to the hypothesis that ribavirin's antiviral activity results from error catastrophe caused by increased mutagenesis of viral genomes. Here, we describe the generation of ribavirin-resistant poliovirus by serial viral passage in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drug. Ribavirin resistance can be caused by a single amino acid change, G64S, in the viral polymerase in an unresolved portion of the fingers domain. Compared with wild-type virus, ribavirin-resistant poliovirus displays increased fidelity of RNA synthesis in the absence of ribavirin and increased survival both in the presence of ribavirin and another mutagen, 5-azacytidine. Ribavirin-resistant poliovirus represents an unusual class of viral drug resistance: resistance to a mutagen through increased fidelity.},

  Abstract                 = {The solitary LTRs of ERV-9 human endogenous retrovirus are middle repetitive DNAs associated with 3,000-4,000 human gene loci including the beta-globin gene locus where the ERV-9 LTR is juxtaposed to the locus control region (beta-LCR) far upstream of the globin genes. The ERV-9 LTRs are conserved during primate evolution, but their function in the primate genomes is unknown. Here, we show that in transgenic zebrafish harboring the beta-globin ERV-9 LTR coupled to the GFP gene, the LTR enhancer was active and initiated synthesis of GFP mRNA in oocytes but not in spermatozoa, and GFP expression in the embryos was maternally inherited. The LTR enhancer was active also in stem/progenitor cell regions of adult tissues of transgenic zebrafish. In human tissues, ERV-9 LTR enhancer was active also in oocytes and stem/progenitor cells but not in spermatozoa and a number of differentiated, adult somatic cells. Transcriptional analyses of the human beta-globin gene locus showed that the beta-globin ERV-9 LTR enhancer initiated RNA synthesis from the LTR in the direction of the downstream beta locus control region and globin genes in ovary and erythroid progenitor cells. The findings suggest that, during oogenesis, ERV-9 LTR enhancers in the human genome could activate the cis-linked gene loci to synthesize maternal mRNAs required for early embryogenesis. Alternatively, the ERV-9 LTR enhancers, in initiating RNA syntheses into the downstream genomic DNAs, could transcriptionally potentiate and preset chromatin structure of the cis-linked gene loci in oocytes and adult stem/progenitor cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Reports of HIV-1 superinfection (re-infection) have demonstrated that the immune response generated against one strain of HIV-1 does not always protect against other strains. However, studies to determine the incidence of HIV-1 superinfection have yielded conflicting results. Furthermore, few studies have attempted to identify superinfection cases occurring more than a year after initial infection, a time when HIV-1-specific immune responses would be most likely to have developed. We screened a cohort of high-risk Kenyan women for HIV-1 superinfection by comparing partial gag and envelope sequences over a 5-y period beginning at primary infection. Among 36 individuals, we detected seven cases of superinfection, including cases in which both viruses belonged to the same HIV-1 subtype, subtype A. In five of these cases, the superinfecting strain was detected in only one of the two genome regions examined, suggesting that recombination frequently occurs following HIV-1 superinfection. In addition, we found that superinfection occurred throughout the course of the first infection: during acute infection in two cases, between 1-2 y after infection in three cases, and as late as 5 y after infection in two cases. Our results indicate that superinfection commonly occurs after the immune response against the initial infection has had time to develop and mature. Implications from HIV-1 superinfection cases, in which natural re-exposure leads to re-infection, will need to be considered in developing strategies for eliciting protective immunity to HIV-1.},

The majority of translational control occurs at the level of initiation, thus implicating the 5' untranslated region as a major site of translational regulation. Many growth-related mRNAs have atypical 5' UTRs, which are often long and GC-rich. Such features promote formation of stable secondary structure, and many mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis have structured 5' UTRs, which in many cases harbour internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and upstream open-reading frames (uORFs). In this review we discuss how secondary structural elements in the 5' UTR can regulate translation and how mutations that perturb these secondary structural elements can have implications for disease and tumourigenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {As 16S rRNA gene targeted massively parallel sequencing has become a common tool for microbial diversity investigations, numerous advances have been made to minimize the influence of sequencing and chimeric PCR artifacts through rigorous quality control measures. However, there has been little effort towards understanding the effect of multi-template PCR biases on microbial community structure. In this study, we used three bacterial and three archaeal mock communities consisting of, respectively, 33 bacterial and 24 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences combined in different proportions to compare the influences of (1) sequencing depth, (2) sequencing artifacts (sequencing errors and chimeric PCR artifacts), and (3) biases in multi-template PCR, towards the interpretation of community structure in pyrosequencing datasets. We also assessed the influence of each of these three variables on α- and β-diversity metrics that rely on the number of OTUs alone (richness) and those that include both membership and the relative abundance of detected OTUs (diversity). As part of this study, we redesigned bacterial and archaeal primer sets that target the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene, along with multiplexing barcodes, to permit simultaneous sequencing of PCR products from the two domains. We conclude that the benefits of deeper sequencing efforts extend beyond greater OTU detection and result in higher precision in β-diversity analyses by reducing the variability between replicate libraries, despite the presence of more sequencing artifacts. Additionally, spurious OTUs resulting from sequencing errors have a significant impact on richness or shared-richness based α- and β-diversity metrics, whereas metrics that utilize community structure (including both richness and relative abundance of OTUs) are minimally affected by spurious OTUs. However, the greatest obstacle towards accurately evaluating community structure are the errors in estimated mean relative abundance of each detected OTU due to biases associated with multi-template PCR reactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Microarrays strategies, which allow for the characterization of thousands of alternative splice forms in a single test, can be applied to identify differential alternative splicing events. In this study, a novel splice array approach was developed, including the design of a high-density oligonucleotide array, a labeling procedure, and an algorithm to identify splice events.The array consisted of exon probes and thermodynamically balanced junction probes. Suboptimal probes were tagged and considered in the final analysis. An unbiased labeling protocol was developed using random primers. The algorithm used to distinguish changes in expression from changes in splicing was calibrated using internal non-spliced control sequences. The performance of this splice array was validated with artificial constructs for CDC6, VEGF, and PCBP4 isoforms. The platform was then applied to the analysis of differential splice forms in lung cancer samples compared to matched normal lung tissue. Overexpression of splice isoforms was identified for genes encoding CEACAM1, FHL-1, MLPH, and SUSD2. None of these splicing isoforms had been previously associated with lung cancer.This methodology enables the detection of alternative splicing events in complex biological samples, providing a powerful tool to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer and other pathologies.},

  Abstract                 = {38 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were identified in Kinshasa, Zaire, during a 3 week period in 1983. The male to female ratio was 1.1:1. The annual case rate for Kinshasa was estimated to be at least 17 per 100 000. Opportunistic infections were diagnosed in 32 (84\%) patients, disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with opportunistic infection in 5 (13\%), and disseminated KS alone in 1 patient. Immunological characteristics of these patients were as reported for cases in the USA and Europe, but immunological abnormalities were also found in 6 controls with infectious diseases but no symptoms of AIDS. Female AIDS cases were younger than male patients with AIDS (mean ages 28.4 vs 41.1 years, respectively), and were more often single (14/18 vs 2/20). Homosexuality, intravenous drug abuse, and blood transfusion did not appear to be risk factors in these patients. The findings of this study strongly argue that the situation in central Africa represents a new epidemiological setting for this worldwide disease--that of significant transmission in a large heterosexual population. Two instances of clusters of AIDS (not included in the above series) involving males and females with frequent heterosexual contact further implicate heterosexual transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {Our previous studies on nascent transcription across the human beta-globin gene cluster revealed the presence of intergenic transcripts in addition to the expected genic transcripts. We now show that transcription into the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) begins within an ERV9 endogenous retroviral long terminal repeat upstream of DNase I hypersensitive site 5. However, in a transgenic mouse, which has the human beta-globin LCR but lacks the ERV9 LTR, transcription begins upstream of the transgenic locus. We postulate that in this transgenic mouse nearby endogenous mouse promoters are activated by the LCR. Intergenic transcription is also detected across the whole transgenic globin gene locus independently of the stage of erythroid development. Intergenic transcription in the beta-globin cluster is erythroid specific; however, it can be induced in nonerythroid cells by several means: by transinduction with a plasmid transcribing part of the cluster, by exogenous addition of transcription factors, and by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.},

Here we show that addition of deoxynucleosides enhanced integration and 2LTR formation in resting CD4+ T cells but that the kinetics were still significantly delayed compared to those of activated T cells. Thus, deoxynucleoside addition partially overcomes the restriction to HIV infection in resting CD4+ T cells.},

Some of the clones permanently grow and continuously produce large amounts of virus after infection with cytopathic (HTLV-III) variants of these viruses. One cytopathic effect of HTLV-III in this system is the arrangement of multiple nuclei in a characteristic ring formation in giant cells of the infected T-cell population. These structures can be used as an indicator to detect HTLV-III in clinical specimens. This system opens the way to the routine detection of HTLV-III and related cytopathic variants of HTLV in patients with AIDS or pre-AIDS and in healthy carriers, and it provides large amounts of virus for detailed molecular and immunological analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine the frequency of dual inter- and intra-subtype HIV-1 infection among a cohort of 64 longitudinally-studied, HIV-1-positive individuals in Yaoundé, Cameroon.Blood was collected every 3-6 months for up to 36 months and RNA was extracted from plasma. Gag fragment (HxB2 location 1577-2040) was amplified by nested RT-PCR, and mixed-time-point Heteroduplex Assays (HDAs) were performed. As heteroduplexes in this assay indicate >or=5\% genetic discordance in the gag fragment, their presence reveals dual infection. Results were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis.Heteroduplexes were generated by specimens of 10 subjects (15.6\%). Kaplan-Meier nonparametric estimate of maintenance of single infection was calculated; the rate/year of a 2 infection was found to be approximately 11\%. Dual infection was identified in the final specimens of five subjects, after as much as 18 months follow-up, while for the remaining five subjects, dual infection was identified in interim specimens within an average of 10 months follow-up. Analysis of samples obtained after dual infection from each of these latter five subjects revealed two patterns: reversion to initial strain, or replacement of initial strain. Four subjects were dually-infected with HIV-1 strains of the same subtype, while 6 were infected with different subtypes.The high prevalence of recombinant HIV-1 strains in Cameroon may in part be explained by the high frequency of dual infection. In this genetically-diverse HIV-1 milieu, dual infections and the recombinant viruses they generate are strongly driving viral evolution, complicating vaccine strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Modern gene therapy methods have limited control over where a therapeutic viral vector inserts into the host genome. Vector integration can activate local gene expression, which can cause cancer if the vector inserts near an oncogene. Viral integration hot-spots or `common insertion sites' (CIS) are scrutinized to evaluate and predict patient safety. CIS are typically defined by a minimum density of insertions (such as 2-4 within a 30-100kb region), which unfortunately depends on the total number of observed VIS. This is problematic for comparing hot-spot distributions across data sets and patients, where the VIS numbers may vary. RESULTS: We develop two new methods for defining hot-spots that are relatively independent of data set size. Both methods operate on distributions of VIS across consecutive 1Mb `bins' of the genome. The first method `z-threshold' tallies the number of VIS per bin, converts these counts to z-scores, and applies a threshold to define high density bins. The second method `BCP' applies a Bayesian change-point model to the z-scores to define hot-spots. The novel hot-spot methods are compared with a conventional CIS method using simulated data sets and data sets from five published human studies, including the X-linked ALD (adrenoleukodystrophy), CGD (chronic granulomatous disease) and SCID-X1 (X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency) trials. The BCP analysis of the human X-linked ALD data for two patients separately (774 and 1627 VIS) and combined (2401 VIS) resulted in 5-6 hot-spots covering 0.17-0.251\% of the genome and containing 5.56-7.74\% of the total VIS. In comparison, the CIS analysis resulted in 12-110 hot-spots covering 0.018-0.246\% of the genome and containing 5.81-22.7\% of the VIS, corresponding to a greater number of hot-spots as the data set size increased. Our hot-spot methods enable one to evaluate the extent of VIS clustering, and formally compare data sets in terms of hot-spot overlap. Finally, we show that the BCP hot-spots from the repopulating samples coincide with greater gene and CpG island density than the median genome density. CONCLUSIONS: The z-threshold and BCP methods are useful for comparing hot-spot patterns across data sets of disparate sizes. The methodology and software provided here should enable one to study hot-spot conservation across a variety of VIS data sets and evaluate vector safety for gene therapy trials.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shows extensive genetic variation and undergoes rapid evolution. The fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was measured during DNA polymerization in vitro by means of three different assays. Reverse transcriptase from HIV-1 introduced base-substitution errors in DNA from the bacteriophage phi X174 amber3 at estimated frequencies of 1/2000 to 1/4000. Analyses of misincorporation rates opposite a single template adenine residue showed that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase catalyzed nucleotide mismatches with a specificity of A:C much greater than A:G greater than A:A. The high error rate of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in vitro translates to approximately five to ten errors per HIV-1 genome per round of replication in vivo. This high error rate suggests that misincorporation by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is, at least in part, responsible for the hypermutability of the AIDS virus. The specificity of misincorporation may provide a basis for the systematic construction of antiviral nucleosides.},

  Abstract                 = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present FastTree, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, FastTree stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. FastTree uses these profiles to implement neighbor-joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. FastTree then uses nearest-neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N2) space and O(N2L) time, but FastTree requires just O(Formula ) memory and O(Formula ) time. To estimate the tree's reliability, FastTree uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, FastTree computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs in 17 hours and 2.4 gigabytes of memory. Just computing pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 hours and 50 gigabytes of memory. In simulations, FastTree was slightly more accurate than neighbor joining, BIONJ, or FastME; on genuine alignments, FastTree's topologies had higher likelihoods.

  Abstract                 = {In the analysis of homologous sequences, computation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) has become a bottleneck. This is especially troublesome for marker genes like the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) where already millions of sequences are publicly available and individual studies can easily produce hundreds of thousands of new sequences. Methods have been developed to cope with such numbers, but further improvements are needed to meet accuracy requirements.In this study, we present the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA) used to align the rRNA gene databases provided by the SILVA ribosomal RNA project. SINA uses a combination of k-mer searching and partial order alignment (POA) to maintain very high alignment accuracy while satisfying high throughput performance demands. SINA was evaluated in comparison with the commonly used high throughput MSA programs PyNAST and mothur. The three BRAliBase III benchmark MSAs could be reproduced with 99.3, 97.6 and 96.1 accuracy. A larger benchmark MSA comprising 38 772 sequences could be reproduced with 98.9 and 99.3\% accuracy using reference MSAs comprising 1000 and 5000 sequences. SINA was able to achieve higher accuracy than PyNAST and mothur in all performed benchmarks.Alignment of up to 500 sequences using the latest SILVA SSU/LSU Ref datasets as reference MSA is offered at http://www.arb-silva.de/aligner.

  Abstract                 = {Multiple RNA splicing sites exist within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomic RNA, and these sites enable the synthesis of many mRNAs for each of several viral proteins. We evaluated the biological significance of the alternatively spliced mRNA species during productive HIV-1 infections of peripheral blood lymphocytes and human T-cell lines to determine the potential role of alternative RNA splicing in the regulation of HIV-1 replication and infection. First, we used a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction of cDNAs that were radiolabeled for gel analysis to determine the relative abundance of the diverse array of alternatively spliced HIV-1 mRNAs. The predominant rev, tat, vpr, and env RNAs contained a minimum of noncoding sequence, but the predominant nef mRNAs were incompletely spliced and invariably included noncoding exons. Second, the effect of altered RNA processing was measured following mutagenesis of the major 5' splice donor and several cryptic, constitutive, and competing 3' splice acceptor motifs of HIV-1NL4-3. Mutations that ablated constitutive splice sites led to the activation of new cryptic sites; some of these preserved biological function. Mutations that ablated competing splice acceptor sites caused marked alterations in the pool of virus-derived mRNAs and, in some instances, in virus infectivity and/or the profile of virus proteins. The redundant RNA splicing signals in the HIV-1 genome and alternatively spliced mRNAs provides a mechanism for regulating the relative proportions of HIV-1 proteins and, in some cases, viral infectivity.},

Our results were obtained on one sequencing instrument by a single operator with four data collection runs. Single-molecule sequencing enabled analysis of human genomic information without the need for cloning, amplification or ligation. We determined approx2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a false-positive rate of less than 1% as validated by Sanger sequencing and 99.8% concordance with SNP genotyping arrays. We identified 752 regions of copy number variation by analyzing coverage depth alone and validated 27 of these using digital PCR.

  Abstract                 = {The RNA silencing pathway is an intracellular innate response to virus infections and retro-transposons. Many plant viruses counter this host restriction by RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) activity of a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, e.g., tomato bushy stunt virus P19. Here, we demonstrate P19 and HIV-1 Tat function across the plant and animal kingdoms and suppress a common step in RNA silencing that is downstream of small RNA maturation. Our experiments reveal that RNA silencing in HIV-1 infected human cells severely attenuates the translational output of the unspliced HIV-1 gag mRNA, and possibly all HIV-1 transcripts. The attenuation in gag mRNA translation is exacerbated by K51A substitution in the Tat double-stranded RNA-binding domain. Tat, plant virus RSS, or Dicer downregulation rescues robust gag translation and bolsters HIV-1 virion production. The reversal of HIV-1 translation repression by plant RSS supports the recent finding in Arabidopsis that plant miRNAs operate by translational inhibition. Our results identify common features between RNA silencing suppression of plant and animal viruses. We suggest that RNA silencing-mediated translation repression plays a strategic role in determining the viral set-point in a newly HIV-1-infected patient.},

  Abstract                 = {Interferons (IFNs) inhibit cell growth in a Stat1-dependent fashion that involves regulation of c-myc expression. IFN-gamma suppresses c-myc in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts, but not in Stat1-null cells, where IFNs induce c-myc mRNA rapidly and transiently, thus revealing a novel signaling pathway. Both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat1 are required for suppression. Induced expression of c-myc is likely to contribute to the proliferation of Stat1-null cells in response to IFNs. IFNs also suppress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced c-myc expression in wild-type but not in Stat1-null cells. A gamma-activated sequence element in the promoter is necessary but not sufficient to suppress c-myc expression in wild-type cells. In PKR-null cells, the phosphorylation of Stat1 on Ser727 and transactivation are both defective, and c-myc mRNA is induced, not suppressed, in response to IFN-gamma. A role for Raf-1 in the Stat1-independent pathway is revealed by studies with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, and by expression of a mutant of p50(cdc37) that is unable to recruit HSP90 to the Raf-1 complex. Both agents abrogated the IFN-gamma-dependent induction of c-myc expression in Stat1-null cells.},

Here we describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our protocol will be useful for addressing fundamental biological problems requiring genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rare cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is able to replicate in primary human macrophages without stimulating innate immunity despite reverse transcription of genomic RNA into double-stranded DNA, an activity that might be expected to trigger innate pattern recognition receptors. We reasoned that if correctly orchestrated HIV-1 uncoating and nuclear entry is important for evasion of innate sensors then manipulation of specific interactions between HIV-1 capsid and host factors that putatively regulate these processes should trigger pattern recognition receptors and stimulate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion. Here we show that HIV-1 capsid mutants N74D and P90A, which are impaired for interaction with cofactors cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) and cyclophilins (Nup358 and CypA), respectively, cannot replicate in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages because they trigger innate sensors leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB and IRF3, the production of soluble type 1 IFN and induction of an antiviral state. Depletion of CPSF6 with short hairpin RNA expression allows wild-type virus to trigger innate sensors and IFN production. In each case, suppressed replication is rescued by IFN-receptor blockade, demonstrating a role for IFN in restriction. IFN production is dependent on viral reverse transcription but not integration, indicating that a viral reverse transcription product comprises the HIV-1 pathogen-associated molecular pattern. Finally, we show that we can pharmacologically induce wild-type HIV-1 infection to stimulate IFN secretion and an antiviral state using a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analogue. We conclude that HIV-1 has evolved to use CPSF6 and cyclophilins to cloak its replication, allowing evasion of innate immune sensors and induction of a cell-autonomous innate immune response in primary human macrophages.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved mechanism that targets aberrant mRNAs for destruction. NMD has also been found to regulate the expression of large numbers of genes in diverse organisms, although the biological role for this is unclear and few evolutionarily conserved targets have been identified. Expression analyses of three Arabidopsis thaliana lines deficient in NMD reveal that the vast majority of NMD-targeted transcripts are associated with response to pathogens. Congruently, NMD mutants, in which these transcripts are elevated, confer partial resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. These findings suggest a biological rationale for the regulation of gene expression by NMD in plants and suggest that manipulation of NMD could offer a new approach for crop protection. Amongst the few non-pathogen responsive NMD-targeted genes, one potential NMD targeted signal, the evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frame (CuORF), was found to be hugely over-represented, raising the possibility that this feature could be used to target specific physiological mRNAs for control by NMD.},

A transcriptional positive-feedback loop generated by the HIV-1 Tat protein appears sufficient to mediate this decision. Here, we describe a coupled wet-lab and computational approach that uses mathematical modeling and live-cell time-lapse microscopy to map the architecture of the HIV-1 Tat transcriptional regulatory circuit and generate predictive models of HIV-1 latency. This approach provided the first characterization of a 'decision-making' circuit that lacks bistability and instead exploits stochastic fluctuations in cellular molecules (i.e. noise) to generate a decision between an on or off transcriptional state.},

Low cyclin B-associated kinase activity, as well as the status of p34cdc2 and cdc25C phosphorylation, indicates that the cascade of reactions which drives the cell into mitosis has not been initiated. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid releases the block, suggesting that Vpr perturbs upstream regulatorsof the G2-M transition. These studies demonstrate that HIV-1 vpr has profound effects on the cellular factors which control entry into mitosis and indicate vpr's potential contribution to the cellular pathology associated with HIV-1 infection.},

This was compared to primary HIV incidence in 20 220 initially HIV-negative individuals in the general population in Rakai (1.15 per 100 PYs; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.2; P= .26). Propensity score matching (PS) was used to control for differences in sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics between the HIV-positive individuals at risk for superinfection and the HIV-negative population at baseline and follow-up. After PS matching, the estimated rate of primary incidence was 3.28 per 100 PYs (95\% CI, 2.0-5.3; P = .07) controlling for baseline differences and 2.51 per 100 PYs (95\% CI, 1.5-4.3; P = .24) controlling for follow-up differences.This suggests that the rate of HIV superinfection in a general population is substantial, which could have a significant impact on future public health and HIV vaccine strategies.},

Primary HIV incidence was determined from initially HIV-uninfected FSWs from the same cohort, and incidence rate ratios were compared.The rate of superinfection in these women (7/85; 3.4/100 person-years) was not significantly different from the rate of primary infection in the same population (3.7/100 person-years; incidence rate ratio = 0.91, P = 0.42). Seven women also entered the study dual-infected (16.5\% either dual or superinfected). The women with any presence of dual infection were more likely to report sex work as their only source of income (P = 0.05), and trended to be older and more likely to be widowed (P = 0.07).In this cohort of FSWs, HIV superinfection occurred at a high rate and was similar to that of primary HIV infection. These results differ from a similar study of high-risk female bar workers in Kenya that found the rate of superinfection to be significantly lower than the rate of primary HIV infection.},

Such an understanding would be of fundamental importance and potentially useful for designing and evaluating anti-HIV strategies. As a first step toward addressing this need we formulate and implement here a global computer simulation for the intracellular growth of HIV-1 on a CD4+ T lymphocyte. Our simulation accounts for the kinetics of reverse transcription, integration of proviral DNA into the host genome, transcription, mRNA splicing and transport from the nucleus, translation, feedback of regulatory proteins to the nucleus, transport of viral proteins to the cell membrane, particle assembly, budding, and maturation. The simulation quantitatively captures the experimentally observed intracellular dynamics of viral DNA, mRNA, and proteins while employing no "fudge factors." Moreover, it provides an estimate of the intracellular growth rate of HIV-1 and enables evaluation of mono- and combined anti-HIV strategies.},

In addition, recent advances have revealed mechanisms for the co-transcriptional loading of the export machinery on to mRNAs.

NNRTI-based HAART regimes effectively suppress viral reproduction, are not cytotoxic and show favourable pharmacokinetic properties. First-generation NNRTIs suffer the rapid selection of viral variants, hampering the binding of inhibitors into the reverse transcriptase (RT) non-nucleoside binding site (NNBS). Efforts to improve these first inhibitors led to the discovery of second-generation NNRTIs that proved to be effective against the drug-resistant mutant HIV-1 strains. The success of such agents launched a new season of NNRTI design and synthesis. This paper reviews the characteristics of second-generation NNRTIs, including etravirine, rilpivirine, RDEA-806, UK-453061, BIRL 355 BS, IDX 899, MK-4965 and HBY 097. In particular, the binding modes of these inhibitors into the NNBS of the HIV-1 RT and the most clinically relevant mutant RTs are analysed and discussed.},

Simian immunodeficiency virus-infected resting cells could accordingly be responsible for 70 to 93\% of peak virus production in the acute stage of infection.Whereas in 'snap-shots' the infected resting cells apparently produce much less virus than infected activated CD4+ T cells, the coincidence of peak SIV production with predominant infection of resting cells along with longer half-lives for productively infected resting cells point to a major contribution to virus production in early infection.},

  Abstract                 = {The HIV-2 serotype of HIV is a cause of disease in parts of the West African population, and there is evidence for its spread to Europe and Asia. HIV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) demonstrates an intrinsic resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), one of two classes of anti-AIDS drugs that target the viral RT. We report the crystal structure of HIV-2 RT to 2.35 A resolution, which reveals molecular details of the resistance to NNRTIs. HIV-2 RT has a similar overall fold to HIV-1 RT but has structural differences within the "NNRTI pocket" at both conserved and nonconserved residues. The structure points to the role of sequence differences that can give rise to unfavorable inhibitor contacts or destabilization of part of the binding pocket at positions 101, 106, 138, 181, 188, and 190. We also present evidence that the conformation of Ile-181 compared with the HIV-1 Tyr-181 could be a significant contributory factor to this inherent drug resistance of HIV-2 to NNRTIs. The availability of a refined structure of HIV-2 RT will provide a stimulus for the structure-based design of novel non-nucleoside inhibitors that could be used against HIV-2 infection.},

Classification of HIV-1 positivity in utero was based on PCR results at birth. Infants were classified as intrapartum infected if they scored negative for the sample collected at birth and positive for the sample collected at 6 weeks of age.We found significant differences in the distribution of transmission time according to subtype. A higher proportion of HIV-1 with subtype C env (C-env) was transmitted in utero than HIV-1 with subtype A env (A-env), subtype D env (D-env), or both combined.The identification of patterns of mother-to-child transmission times among HIV-1 genotypes may be useful in the selection of drug regimens for chemoprophylaxis. Based on our results, the efficacy of regimens administered only at labor may not protect as large a fraction of infants born in geographical regions with subtype C-env epidemics as compared to epidemics in regions where subtypes A-env and D-env predominate in the population.},

The primary analysis evaluated vaccine efficacy (VEP) as the percent reduction (vaccine vs placebo) in cumulative probability of a primary composite endpoint of clinical and CD4(+) count components at prespecified time points after infection. Secondary analyses of biomarker-based endpoints were assessed using marginal mean and linear mixed models.There were 61 endpoints in the modified intent-to-treat cohort (mITT; n = 114). There was no evidence for efficacy at 30, 42, 54, and 60 months in the mITT and per protocol (n = 90) cohorts. Estimated VEP (mITT) was15.8\% (-21.9, 41.8) at 60 months postinfection. There was weak evidence of lower VL and higher CD4(+) count at 60 and 66 months in the vaccine group. Lower mucosal VL was observed among vaccine recipients, primarily in semen (P = .04).Vaccination did not affect the clinical course of HIV disease after infection. A potential vaccine effect on the genital mucosa warrants further study.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of a safe and effective vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical to pandemic control.In a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial, we evaluated four priming injections of a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) plus two booster injections of a recombinant glycoprotein 120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E). The vaccine and placebo injections were administered to 16,402 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 years in Rayong and Chon Buri provinces in Thailand. The volunteers, primarily at heterosexual risk for HIV infection, were monitored for the coprimary end points: HIV-1 infection and early HIV-1 viremia, at the end of the 6-month vaccination series and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years.In the intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,402 subjects, there was a trend toward the prevention of HIV-1 infection among the vaccine recipients, with a vaccine efficacy of 26.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], -4.0 to 47.9; P=0.08). In the per-protocol analysis involving 12,542 subjects, the vaccine efficacy was 26.2\% (95\% CI, -13.3 to 51.9; P=0.16). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,395 subjects (with the exclusion of 7 subjects who were found to have had HIV-1 infection at baseline), the vaccine efficacy was 31.2\% (95\% CI, 1.1 to 52.1; P=0.04). Vaccination did not affect the degree of viremia or the CD4+ T-cell count in subjects in whom HIV-1 infection was subsequently diagnosed.This ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX B/E vaccine regimen may reduce the risk of HIV infection in a community-based population with largely heterosexual risk. Vaccination did not affect the viral load or CD4+ count in subjects with HIV infection. Although the results show only a modest benefit, they offer insight for future research.

  Abstract                 = {Variegated phenotypes often result from chromosomal rearrangements that place euchromatic genes next to heterochromatin. In such rearrangements, the condensed structure of heterochromatin can spread into euchromatic regions, which then assume the morphology of heterochromatin and become transcriptionally inactive. In position-effect variegation (PEV) therefore, gene inactivation results from a change in chromatin structure. PEV has been intensively investigated in the fruitfly Drosophila, where the phenomenon allows a genetic dissection of chromatin components. Consequently, many genes have been identified which, when mutated, act as dominant modifiers (suppressors or enhancers) of PEV. Data available already demonstrate that genetic, molecular and developmental analysis of these genes provides an avenue to the identification of regulatory and structural chromatin components, and hence to fundamental aspects of chromosome structure and function.},

  Abstract                 = {A sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay was developed for four mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that have been associated with zidovudine resistance. These mutations were correlated in 366 specimens with zidovudine chemotherapy and resistance. Mutations at these four codons were detected only after zidovudine therapy. The usual sequence of appearance of mutations was codons 215, 70, 67, and 219, although individual variations occurred. The degree of resistance was proportional to the number of mutations present, although variable susceptibilities with identical patterns of mutations suggested the likelihood that additional mutations contribute to resistance. The existence of both phenotypic and genotypic mixtures was documented as was the occasional selection of subpopulations with passage of virus in vitro. The many complexities of zidovudine resistance render the assay of limited use for application to individual patients; however, it could prove useful for correlating disease or therapy with the emergence of resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug susceptibility and mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene were analyzed with 167 virus isolates from 38 patients treated with nevirapine, a potent nonnucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT. Resistant isolates emerged quickly and uniformly in all patients administered nevirapine either as monotherapy or in combination with zidovudine (AZT). Resistance developed as early as 1 week, indicating rapid turnover of the virus population. The development of resistance was associated with the loss of antiviral drug activity as measured by CD4 lymphocyte counts and levels of HIV p24 antigen and RNA in serum. In addition to mutations at amino acid residues 103, 106, and 181 that had been identified by selection in cell culture, mutations at residues 108, 188, and 190 were also found in the patient isolates. Sequences from patient clones documented cocirculating mixtures of populations of different mutants. The most common mutation with monotherapy, tyrosine to cysteine at residue 181, was prevented from emerging by coadministration of AZT, which resulted in the selection of alternative mutations. The observations documented that, under selective drug pressure, the circulating virus population can change rapidly, and many alternative mutants can emerge, often in complex mixtures. The addition of a second RT inhibitor, AZT, significantly altered the pattern of mutations in the circulating population of HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, including mRNA localization, translation and decay, is ubiquitous yet still largely unexplored. How is the post-transcriptional regulatory program of each mRNA encoded in its sequence? Hundreds of specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) appear to play roles in mediating the post-transcriptional regulatory program, akin to the roles of specific DNA-binding proteins in transcription. As a step toward decoding the regulatory programs encoded in each mRNA, we focused on specific mRNA-protein interactions. We computationally analyzed the sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNAs bound in vivo by 29 specific RBPs, identifying eight novel candidate motifs and confirming or extending six earlier reported recognition elements. Biochemical selections for RNA sequences selectively recognized by 12 yeast RBPs yielded novel motifs bound by Pin4, Nsr1, Hrb1, Gbp2, Sgn1 and Mrn1, and recovered the known recognition elements for Puf3, She2, Vts1 and Whi3. Most of the RNA elements we uncovered were associated with coherent mRNA expression changes and were significantly conserved in related yeasts, supporting their functional importance and suggesting that the corresponding RNA-protein interactions are evolutionarily conserved.},

We clarify the relationships existing between these tests, in particular the equivalence between the hypergeometric test and Fisher's exact test. We recall that the other tests are valid only for large samples, the test of equality of two probabilities and the chi2-test being equivalent. We discuss the appropriateness of one- and two-sided P-values, as well as some discreteness and conservatism issues.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {A study was conducted to determine the fidelity of DNA synthesis catalyzed in vitro by the reverse transcriptase from a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Like other retroviral reverse transcriptases, the HIV-1 enzyme does not correct errors by exonucleolytic proofreading. Measurements with M13mp2-based fidelity assays indicated that the HIV-1 enzyme, isolated either from virus particles or from Escherichia coli cells infected with a plasmid expressing the cloned gene, was exceptionally inaccurate, having an average error rate per detectable nucleotide incorporated of 1/1700. It was, in fact, the least accurate reverse transcriptase described to date, one-tenth as accurate as the polymerases isolated from avian myeloblastosis or murine leukemia viruses, which have average error rates of approximately 1/17,000 and approximately 1/30,000, respectively. DNA sequence analyses of mutations generated by HIV-1 polymerase showed that base substitution, addition, and deletion errors were all produced. Certain template positions were mutational hotspots where the error rate could be as high as 1 per 70 polymerized nucleotides. The data are consistent with the notion that the exceptional diversity of the HIV-1 genome results from error-prone reverse transcription.},

Here we show that although Vpr has no effect on the initial cytopathic effect of HIV-1, viruses that contain an intact vpr gene are unable to establish a chronic infection of T cells. However, virus with a mutated vpr gene can readily establish such long-term cultures. The effect of Vpr is independent of the env gene and the nef gene. Furthermore, expression of Vpr alone affects the progression of cells in the cell cycle. These results suggest that HIV-1 has evolved a viral gene to prevent chronic infection of T cells.},

  Abstract                 = {A subpopulation of stably infected CD4+ cells capable of producing virus upon stimulation has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals (T.-W. Chun, D. Finzi, J. Margolick, K. Chadwick, D. Schwartz, and R. F. Siliciano, Nat. Med. 1:1284-1290, 1995). Few host factors that directly limit HIV-1 transcription and could support this state of nonproductive HIV-1 infection have been described. YY1, a widely distributed human transcription factor, is known to inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription and virus production. LSF (also known as LBP-1, UBP, and CP-2) has been shown to repress LTR transcription in vitro, but transient expression of LSF has no effect on LTR activity in vivo. We report that both YY1 and LSF participate in the formation of a complex that recognizes the initiation region of the HIV-1 LTR. Further, we have found that these factors cooperate in the repression of LTR expression and viral replication. This cooperative function may account for the divergent effects of LSF previously observed in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the cooperation of two general cellular transcription factors may allow for the selective downregulation of HIV transcription. Through this mechanism of gene regulation, YY1 and LSF could contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a population of cells stably but nonproductively infected with HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV superinfection (reinfection) has been reported in several settings, but no study has been designed and powered to rigorously compare its incidence to that of initial infection. Determining whether HIV infection reduces the risk of superinfection is critical to understanding whether an immune response to natural HIV infection is protective. This study compares the incidence of initial infection and superinfection in a prospective seroincident cohort of high-risk women in Mombasa, Kenya. A next-generation sequencing-based pipeline was developed to screen 129 women for superinfection. Longitudinal plasma samples at <6 months, >2 years and one intervening time after initial HIV infection were analyzed. Amplicons in three genome regions were sequenced and a median of 901 sequences obtained per gene per timepoint. Phylogenetic evidence of polyphyly, confirmed by pairwise distance analysis, defined superinfection. Superinfection timing was determined by sequencing virus from intervening timepoints. These data were combined with published data from 17 additional women in the same cohort, totaling 146 women screened. Twenty-one cases of superinfection were identified for an estimated incidence rate of 2.61 per 100 person-years (pys). The incidence rate of initial infection among 1910 women in the same cohort was 5.75 per 100 pys. Andersen-Gill proportional hazards models were used to compare incidences, adjusting for covariates known to influence HIV susceptibility in this cohort. Superinfection incidence was significantly lower than initial infection incidence, with a hazard ratio of 0.47 (CI 0.29-0.75, p = 0.0019). This lower incidence of superinfection was only observed >6 months after initial infection. This is the first adequately powered study to report that HIV infection reduces the risk of reinfection, raising the possibility that immune responses to natural infection are partially protective. The observation that superinfection risk changes with time implies a window of protection that coincides with the maturation of HIV-specific immunity.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 superinfection occurs frequently in high-risk populations, but its clinical consequences remain poorly characterized. We undertook this study to determine the impact of HIV-1 superinfection on disease progression.In the largest prospective cohort study of superinfection to date, we compared measures of HIV-1 progression in women who acquired superinfection with those who did not. Clinical and laboratory data were collected at quarterly intervals. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare postacute viral load and CD4 T-cell counts over time in singly infected and superinfected women. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the effect of superinfection on time to clinical progression [CD4 cell count <200 cells/μl, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation or death].Among 144 women, 21 of whom acquired superinfection during follow-up, the rate of viral load increase was higher in superinfected than in singly infected women (P = 0.0008). In adjusted analysis, superinfected women had lower baseline viral load before superinfection (P = 0.05) and a trend for increased viral load at superinfection acquisition (P = 0.09). We also observed a borderline association of superinfection with accelerated CD4 cell count decline (P = 0.06). However, there was no significant difference in time to clinical progression events.These data suggest that superinfection is associated with accelerated progression in laboratory measures of HIV-1 disease, but has a limited impact on the occurrence of clinical events. Our observation that superinfected individuals have lower baseline viral load prior to superinfection suggests that there may be host or viral determinants of susceptibility to superinfection.},

  Abstract                 = {In this report, we demonstrate the purification of DNA and RNA from a 10\% serum sample using an oligonucleotide capture matrix. This approach provides a one-stage, completely aqueous system capable of purifying both RNA and DNA for downstream PCR amplification. The advantages of utilizing the polymer capture matrix method in place of the solid-phase extraction method is that the capture matrix eliminates both guanidine and the 2-propanol wash that can inhibit downstream PCR and competition with proteins for the binding sites that can limit the capacity of the device. This method electrophoreses a biological sample (e.g., serum) containing the nucleic acid target through a polymer matrix with covalently bound oligonucleotides. These capture oligonucleotides selectively hybridize and retain the target nucleic acid, while the other biomolecules and reagents (e.g., SDS) pass through the matrix to waste. Following this purification step, the solution can be heated above the melting temperature of the capture sequence to release the target molecule, which is then electrophoresed to a recovery chamber for subsequent PCR amplification. We demonstrate that the device can be applied to purify both DNA and RNA from serum. The gag region of HIV at a starting concentration of 37.5 copies per microliter was successfully purified from a 10\% serum sample demonstrating the applicability of this method to detect viruses present in low copy numbers.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence is presented which supports a model proposing that differential RNA splicing events may be used in expression of genes of the endocrine system to generate alternative polypeptide hormones. We previously reported that variation in the expression of the gene encoding the small polypeptide hormone calcitonin is associated with the production of a new calcitonin-like or pseudo-calcitonin (psi Cal) mRNA. A plasmid containing psi Cal cDNA sequences has been constructed, and calcitonin genomic clones have been isolated. Hybridization analysis reveals that calcitonin and psi Cal sequences are chromosomally linked and are present in the same nuclear RNA transcripts. Both calcitonin and psi Cal mRNAs are functional and encode different polypeptide products. These data are compatible with the proposed model that alternative RNA splicing of the transcript(s) of the calcitonin gene ultimately results in the production of different polypeptide products.},

  Abstract                 = {Using likelihood-based evolutionary methods, we demonstrate that the broad genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in an infected individual is a consequence of site-specific positive selection for diversity, a likely consequence of immune recognition. In particular, the extent of positive selection appears to be a good predictor of disease duration. Positively selected sites along HIV-1 partial env sequences are numerous but not distributed uniformly. In a sample of eight patients studied longitudinally, the proportion of sites per sample under positive selection was a statistically significant predictor of disease duration. Among long-term progressors, positive selection persisted at sites over time and appears to be associated with helper T-cell epitopes. In contrast, sites under positive selection shifted from one longitudinal sample to the next in short-term progressors. Our study is consistent with the hypothesis that a broad and persistent immunologic response is associated with a slower rate of disease progression. In contrast, narrow, shifting immune responses characterize short-term progressors.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein is required for efficient virus replication in vivo and displays a number of distinct and apparently unrelated biological activities in vitro. Of these, one of the most readily demonstrated is the efficient internalization and degradation of cell-surface CD4, the receptor for the HIV-1 envelope protein. The biological purpose of this internalization has, however, remained unclear.Using human 293T cells expressing high levels of cell-surface CD4 or CD8, we demonstrate that CD4, but not CD8, can dramatically reduce the release of infectious virions bearing the HIV-1 envelope protein and induce a concomitant increase in the accumulation of cell-associated HIV-1 structural proteins. In contrast, CD4 had no effect on the release of HIV-1 bearing a heterologous envelope protein unable to bind CD4. Nef expression totally reversed CD4-mediated inhibition but only if the CD4 used remained susceptible to Nef-induced internalization.These results support the hypothesis that cell-surface CD4 can interact with the envelope protein present on budding HIV-1 virions to inhibit their release. The internalization and degradation of cell-surface CD4 induced by the viral Nef protein can fully reverse this inhibition and is, therefore, likely to facilitate the spread of virus in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA-sequencing has revolutionized biomedical research and, in particular, our ability to study gene alternative splicing. The problem has important implications for human health, as alternative splicing may be involved in malfunctions at the cellular level and multiple diseases. However, the high-dimensional nature of the data and the existence of experimental biases pose serious data analysis challenges. We find that the standard data summaries used to study alternative splicing are severely limited, as they ignore a substantial amount of valuable information. Current data analysis methods are based on such summaries and are hence sub-optimal. Further, they have limited flexibility in accounting for technical biases. We propose novel data summaries and a Bayesian modeling framework that overcome these limitations and determine biases in a non-parametric, highly flexible manner. These summaries adapt naturally to the rapid improvements in sequencing technology. We provide efficient point estimates and uncertainty assessments. The approach allows to study alternative splicing patterns for individual samples and can also be the basis for downstream analyses. We found a several fold improvement in estimation mean square error compared popular approaches in simulations, and substantially higher consistency between replicates in experimental data. Our findings indicate the need for adjusting the routine summarization and analysis of alternative splicing RNA-seq studies. We provide a software implementation in the R package casper.},

  Abstract                 = {High levels of HIV-1 replication during the chronic phase of infection usually correlate with rapid progression to severe immunodeficiency. However, a minority of highly viremic individuals remains asymptomatic and maintains high CD4⁺ T cell counts. This tolerant profile is poorly understood and reminiscent of the widely studied nonprogressive disease model of SIV infection in natural hosts. Here, we identify transcriptome differences between rapid progressors (RPs) and viremic nonprogressors (VNPs) and highlight several genes relevant for the understanding of HIV-1-induced immunosuppression. RPs were characterized by a specific transcriptome profile of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells similar to that observed in pathogenic SIV-infected rhesus macaques. In contrast, VNPs exhibited lower expression of interferon-stimulated genes and shared a common gene regulation profile with nonpathogenic SIV-infected sooty mangabeys. A short list of genes associated with VNP, including CASP1, CD38, LAG3, TNFSF13B, SOCS1, and EEF1D, showed significant correlation with time to disease progression when evaluated in an independent set of CD4⁺ T cell expression data. This work characterizes 2 minimally studied clinical patterns of progression to AIDS, whose analysis may inform our understanding of HIV pathogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {There is great interindividual variability in HIV-1 viral setpoint after seroconversion, some of which is known to be due to genetic differences among infected individuals. Here, our focus is on determining, genome-wide, the contribution of variable gene expression to viral control, and to relate it to genomic DNA polymorphism. RNA was extracted from purified CD4+ T-cells from 137 HIV-1 seroconverters, 16 elite controllers, and 3 healthy blood donors. Expression levels of more than 48,000 mRNA transcripts were assessed by the Human-6 v3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Genome-wide SNP data was generated from genomic DNA using the HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina). We observed two distinct profiles with 260 genes differentially expressed depending on HIV-1 viral load. There was significant upregulation of expression of interferon stimulated genes with increasing viral load, including genes of the intrinsic antiretroviral defense. Upon successful antiretroviral treatment, the transcriptome profile of previously viremic individuals reverted to a pattern comparable to that of elite controllers and of uninfected individuals. Genome-wide evaluation of cis-acting SNPs identified genetic variants modulating expression of 190 genes. Those were compared to the genes whose expression was found associated with viral load: expression of one interferon stimulated gene, OAS1, was found to be regulated by a SNP (rs3177979, p = 4.9E-12); however, we could not detect an independent association of the SNP with viral setpoint. Thus, this study represents an attempt to integrate genome-wide SNP signals with genome-wide expression profiles in the search for biological correlates of HIV-1 control. It underscores the paradox of the association between increasing levels of viral load and greater expression of antiviral defense pathways. It also shows that elite controllers do not have a fully distinctive mRNA expression pattern in CD4+ T cells. Overall, changes in global RNA expression reflect responses to viral replication rather than a mechanism that might explain viral control.},

The group with the most favorable survival rate--white homosexual men 30 to 34 years old who presented with Kaposi's sarcoma only--had a one-year cumulative probability of survival of 80.5 percent; that group was used as the reference group in assessing the effect of five variables: sex, race or ethnic background, age, probable route of acquiring AIDS (risk group), and manifestations of AIDS at diagnosis. The range in the mortality rate was greater than threefold, depending on these variables. Black women who acquired the disease through intravenous drug abuse, for example, had a particularly poor prognosis. The manifestations of disease at diagnosis had the most influence on survival, accounting on average for 56.3 percent of the excess risk. This variable was followed in importance by age (12.2 percent), race or ethnicity (10.6 percent), risk group (8.4 percent), and sex (8.0 percent), with 4.5 percent of the risk attributable to interactions between variables. When we compared subcohorts based on the year of diagnosis (1981 through 1985), we found a significant improvement in the one-year cumulative probability of survival among subjects with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, but not among subjects without P. carinii pneumonia.},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques presents many novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application.With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with regard to accuracy and runtime. Conclusion: We expect that the results presented here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing data for various purposes (e.g. identification of genomic variants).Seal is available as open source at http://compbio.case.edu/seal/.matthew.ruffalo@case.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Interferome v2.0 (http://interferome.its.monash.edu.au/interferome/) is an update of an earlier version of the Interferome DB published in the 2009 NAR database edition. Vastly improved computational infrastructure now enables more complex and faster queries, and supports more data sets from types I, II and III interferon (IFN)-treated cells, mice or humans. Quantitative, MIAME compliant data are collected, subjected to thorough, standardized, quantitative and statistical analyses and then significant changes in gene expression are uploaded. Comprehensive manual collection of metadata in v2.0 allows flexible, detailed search capacity including the parameters: range of -fold change, IFN type, concentration and time, and cell/tissue type. There is no limit to the number of genes that can be used to search the database in a single query. Secondary analysis such as gene ontology, regulatory factors, chromosomal location or tissue expression plots of IFN-regulated genes (IRGs) can be performed in Interferome v2.0, or data can be downloaded in convenient text formats compatible with common secondary analysis programs. Given the importance of IFN to innate immune responses in infectious, inflammatory diseases and cancer, this upgrade of the Interferome to version 2.0 will facilitate the identification of gene signatures of importance in the pathogenesis of these diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcription factor binding to DNA requires both an appropriate binding element and suitably open chromatin, which together help to define regulatory elements within the genome. Current methods of identifying regulatory elements, such as promoters or enhancers, typically rely on sequence conservation, existing gene annotations or specific marks, such as histone modifications and p300 binding methods, each of which has its own biases.Herein we show that an approach based on clustering of transcription factor peaks from high-throughput sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (Chip-Seq) can be used to evaluate markers for regulatory elements. We used 67 data sets for 54 unique transcription factors distributed over two cell lines to create regulatory element clusters. By integrating the clusters from our approach with histone modifications and data for open chromatin, we identified general methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me) as the most specific marker for transcription factor clusters. Clusters mapping to annotated genes showed distinct patterns in cluster composition related to gene expression and histone modifications. Clusters mapping to intergenic regions fall into two groups either directly involved in transcription, including miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, or facilitating transcription by long-range interactions. The latter clusters were specifically enriched with H3K4me1, but less with acetylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 or p300 binding.By integrating genomewide data of transcription factor binding and chromatin structure and using our data-driven approach, we pinpointed the chromatin marks that best explain transcription factor association with different regulatory elements. Our results also indicate that a modest selection of transcription factors may be sufficient to map most regulatory elements in the human genome.},

Comparison of expression patterns revealed that 53 cellular genes were differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the altered expression of the genes in both MOLT-4 and MT-4 cells. Up-regulated genes were mainly composed of transcription factors and genes related to T cell activation, whereas down-regulated genes were comprised of mitochondrial proteins, actin-related factors and translational factors. These findings indicate that persistent T cell activation, which may accelerate HIV-1 replication, and the disruption of cellular housekeeping genes including those involved in anti-apoptotic systems, may play an important role in HIV-1-induced pathogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Genotypic variation among independent isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is well known, but its molecular basis and biological consequences are poorly understood. We examined the genesis of molecular variation in HIV-1 by sequential virus isolations from two chronically infected individuals and analysis of recombinant HIV-1 genomic clones. In three different virus isolates full-length HIV-1 clones were identified and found to consist, respectively, of 17, 9 and 13 distinguishable, but highly-related, viral genotypes. Thirty-five viral clones derived from two HIV-1 isolates obtained from the same individual but 16 months apart showed progressive change, yet were clearly related. Similar changes in the HIV-1 genome did not occur in vitro during virus isolation and amplification. The results indicate that HIV-1 variation in vivo is rapid, that a remarkably large number of related but distinguishable genotypic variants evolve in parallel and coexist during chronic infection, and that 'isolates' of HIV-1, unless molecularly or biologically cloned, generally consist of complex mixtures of genotypically distinguishable viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {The abundance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their wide range of functional roles in human cells are fast becoming realized. Importantly, lncRNAs have been identified as epigenetic modulators and consequently play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. A human immunodeficiency virus-encoded antisense RNA transcript has recently been reported and we sought to characterize this RNA and determine its potential role in viral transcription regulation. The intrinsic properties of this human immunodeficiency virus-expressed lncRNA were characterized and the data presented here suggest that it functions as an epigenetic brake to modulate viral transcription. Suppression of this long antisense transcript with small single-stranded antisense RNAs resulted in the activation of viral gene expression. This lncRNA was found to localize to the 5' long-term repeats (LTR) and to usurp components of endogenous cellular pathways that are involved in lncRNA directed epigenetic gene silencing. Collectively, we find that this viral expressed antisense lncRNA is involved in modulating human immunodeficiency virus gene expression and that this regulatory effect is due to an alteration in the epigenetic landscape at the viral promoter.},

On a combination of a convenient and rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a more sensitive electroblot (Western) assay, 100\% of the AIDS sera were scored positive. Similarly, 84\% of the lymphadenopathy patients were found to have serum antibodies to HTLV-III. A lower, but significant, proportion (21\%) of healthy homosexual men with an increased risk of AIDS were also positive. No heterosexual controls, including those with heterophile antibodies during the course of infectious mononucleosis and patients with T-cell or B-cell lymphoma, had antibodies to HTLV-III.

  Abstract                 = {Identification of full-length transmitted HIV-1 genomes could be instrumental in HIV-1 pathogenesis, microbicide, and vaccine research by enabling the direct analysis of those viruses actually responsible for productive clinical infection. We show in 12 acutely infected subjects (9 clade B and 3 clade C) that complete HIV-1 genomes of transmitted/founder viruses can be inferred by single genome amplification and sequencing of plasma virion RNA. This allowed for the molecular cloning and biological analysis of transmitted/founder viruses and a comprehensive genome-wide assessment of the genetic imprint left on the evolving virus quasispecies by a composite of host selection pressures. Transmitted viruses encoded intact canonical genes (gag-pol-vif-vpr-tat-rev-vpu-env-nef) and replicated efficiently in primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes but much less so in monocyte-derived macrophages. Transmitted viruses were CD4 and CCR5 tropic and demonstrated concealment of coreceptor binding surfaces of the envelope bridging sheet and variable loop 3. 2 mo after infection, transmitted/founder viruses in three subjects were nearly completely replaced by viruses differing at two to five highly selected genomic loci; by 12-20 mo, viruses exhibited concentrated mutations at 17-34 discrete locations. These findings reveal viral properties associated with mucosal HIV-1 transmission and a limited set of rapidly evolving adaptive mutations driven primarily, but not exclusively, by early cytotoxic T cell responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Attempts to estimate the time of origin of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 by using phylogenetic analysis are seriously flawed because of the unequal evolutionary rates among different viral lineages. Here, we report a new method of molecular clock analysis, called Site Stripping for Clock Detection (SSCD), which allows selection of nucleotide sites evolving at an equal rate in different lineages. The method was validated on a dataset of patients all infected with hepatitis C virus in 1977 by the same donor, and it was able to date exactly the known origin of the infection. Using the same method, we calculated that the origin of HIV-1 group M radiation was in the 1930s. In addition, we show that the coalescence time of the simian ancestor of HIV-1 group M and its closest related cpz strains occurred around the end of the XVII century, a date that could be considered the upper limit to the time of simian-to-human transmission of HIV-1 group M. The results show also that SSCD is an easy-to-use method of general applicability in molecular evolution to calibrate clock-like phylogenetic trees.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 produces more than 20 mRNAs encoding the viral proteins. We have used a sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach to determine HIV-1 transcriptional patterns during the course of viral infection in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from different patients. Several sets of PCR primers, used in parallel reactions, allowed the amplification and specific detection of almost all individual HIV-1 transcripts. We investigated the transcriptional profile in two individuals during primary acute and early chronic infection. In these individuals, HIV-1 mRNA expression was elevated at the first time points examined and declined over time. In addition, we performed a detailed study of HIV-1 expression in several individuals over a minimum of 7 years following seroconversion. We found that long-term asymptomatic individuals had undetectable or low levels of the three classes of HIV-1 transcripts (unspliced, singly spliced, and multiply spliced). Individuals who demonstrated disease progression showed either a general increase in the amount of expression of all transcripts or elevated levels of unspliced transcripts in late-stage disease. The splicing pattern in each patient was conserved over the years and differed among the different individuals. No evidence of major changes in the splicing pattern was found during disease progression within the same individual. Thus, HIV-1 transcriptional patterns are viral strain specific rather than disease stage specific. These results indicate that high-level expression of any class of HIV-1 transcripts is associated with clinical progression. Our analysis also demonstrates the importance of using more than one set of primers to evaluate HIV-1 RNA expression, since virus in patient PBMCs showed sequence heterogeneity in conserved regions.},

This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs.},

Whether robustness can be directly favored by natural selection remains controversial. Theory and in silico experiments predict that, at high mutation rates, slow-replicating genotypes can potentially outcompete faster counterparts if they benefit from a higher robustness. Here, we experimentally validate this hypothesis, dubbed the "survival of the flattest," using two populations of the vesicular stomatitis RNA virus. Characterization of fitness distributions and genetic variability indicated that one population showed a higher replication rate, whereas the other was more robust to mutation. The faster replicator outgrew its robust counterpart in standard competition assays, but the outcome was reversed in the presence of chemical mutagens. These results show that selection can directly favor mutational robustness and reveal a novel viral resistance mechanism against treatment by lethal mutagenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Certain post-translational modifications to histones, including H3K4me3, as well as binding sites for the transcription factor STAT1, predict the site of integration of exogenous gamma-retroviruses with great accuracy and cell-type specificity. Statistical methods that were used to identify chromatin features that predict exogenous gamma-retrovirus integration site selection were exploited here to determine whether cell type-specific chromatin markers are enriched in the vicinity of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).Among retro-elements in the human genome, the gamma-retrovirus HERV-H was highly associated with H3K4me3, though this association was only observed in embryonic stem (ES) cells (p < 10-300) and, to a lesser extent, in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. No significant association was observed in nearly 40 differentiated cell types, nor was any association observed with other retro-elements. Similar strong association was observed between HERV-H and the binding sites within ES cells for the pluripotency transcription factors NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2. NANOG binding sites were located within the HERV-H 5'LTR itself. OCT4 and SOX2 binding sites were within 1 kB and 2 kB of the 5'LTR, respectively. In keeping with these observations, HERV-H RNA constituted 2\% of all poly A RNA in ES cells. As ES cells progressed down a differentiation pathway, the levels of HERV-H RNA decreased progressively. RNA-Seq datasets showed HERV-H transcripts to be over 5 kB in length and to have the structure 5'LTR-gag-pro-3'LTR, with no evidence of splicing and no intact open reading frames.The developmental regulation of HERV-H expression, the association of HERV-H with binding sites for pluripotency transcription factors, and the extremely high levels of HERV-H RNA in human ES cells suggest that HERV-H contributes to pluripotency in human cells. Proximity of HERV-H to binding sites for pluripotency transcription factors within ES cells might be due to retention of the same chromatin features that determined the site of integration of the ancestral, exogenous, gamma-retrovirus that gave rise to HERV-H in the distant past. Retention of these markers, or, alternatively, recruitment of them to the site of the established provirus, may have acted post-integration to fix the provirus within the germ-line of the host species. Either way, HERV-H RNA provides a specific marker for pluripotency in human cells.},

Disease progression, survival, toxic effects, and the CD4 cell response were assessed.After a median follow-up of 35 months, disease progression or death occurred in 62 percent of the 363 patients assigned to zidovudine plus didanosine, 63 percent of the 367 assigned to zidovudine plus zalcitabine, and 66 percent of the 372 assigned to zidovudine only (P=0.24). As compared with zidovudine therapy, treatment with zidovudine plus didanosine was associated with a relative risk of disease progression or death of 0.86 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.03), and treatment with zidovudine plus zalcitabine was associated with a relative risk of 0.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.10). Survival was similar in the three groups. In a subgroup analysis, combination therapy delayed disease progression or death in patients who had previously received zidovudine for 12 months or less. Therapy with zidovudine plus didanosine resulted in more gastrointestinal adverse effects, and treatment with zidovudine plus zalcitabine, more neuropathy. The mean increases in CD4 cell counts at two months were higher with combination therapy than with zidovudine alone.In patients with advanced HIV infection, combination therapy with zidovudine and either didanosine or zalcitabine is not superior to zidovudine therapy alone. However, these combinations may be more effective than zidovudine monotherapy in patients with little or no previous zidovudine treatment.},

Viruses of a third subgroup of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses, collectively designated HTLV-III, have been isolated from cultured cells of 48 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The biological properties of HTLV-III and immunological analyses of its proteins show that this virus is a member of the HTLV family, and that it is more closely related to HTLV-II than to HTLV-I. Serum samples from 88 percent of patients with AIDS and from 79 percent of homosexual men with signs and symptoms that frequently precede AIDS, but from less than 1 percent of heterosexual subjects, have antibodies reactive against antigens of HTLV-III. The major immune reactivity appears to be directed against p41, the presumed envelope antigen of the virus.},

  Abstract                 = {Latently infected, resting memory CD4+ T cells and macrophages represent a major obstacle to the eradication of HIV-1. For this purpose, "shock and kill" strategies have been proposed (activation of HIV-1 followed by stimuli leading to cell death). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) induce HIV-1 activation from quiescence, yet class/isoform-selective HDACIs are needed to specifically target HIV-1 latency. We tested 32 small molecule HDACIs for their ability to induce HIV-1 activation in the ACH-2 and U1 cell line models. In general, potent activators of HIV-1 replication were found among non-class selective and class I-selective HDACIs. However, class I selectivity did not reduce the toxicity of most of the molecules for uninfected cells, which is a major concern for possible HDACI-based therapies. To overcome this problem, complementary strategies using lower HDACI concentrations have been explored. We added to class I HDACIs the glutathione-synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), in an attempt to create an intracellular environment that would facilitate HIV-1 activation. The basis for this strategy was that HIV-1 replication decreases the intracellular levels of reduced glutathione, creating a pro-oxidant environment which in turn stimulates HIV-1 transcription. We found that BSO increased the ability of class I HDACIs to activate HIV-1. This interaction allowed the use of both types of drugs at concentrations that were non-toxic for uninfected cells, whereas the infected cell cultures succumbed more readily to the drug combination. These effects were associated with BSO-induced recruitment of HDACI-insensitive cells into the responding cell population, as shown in Jurkat cell models for HIV-1 quiescence. The results of the present study may contribute to the future design of class I HDACIs for treating HIV-1. Moreover, the combined effects of class I-selective HDACIs and the glutathione synthesis inhibitor BSO suggest the existence of an Achilles' heel that could be manipulated in order to facilitate the "kill" phase of experimental HIV-1 eradication strategies.},

In this review, we will introduce the sex-determining system of Drosophila and compare the fruitfly to the housefly Musca domestica and other Dipteran insects. Despite the ostensible variety, all these insects use the same basic strategy: a primary genetic signal that is different in males and females, a key gene that responds to the primary signal, and a double-switch gene that eventually selects between two alternative sexual programmes. These parallels, however, do not extend to the molecular level. Except for the double-switch gene doublesex at the end of the cascade, no functional homologies were found between more distantly related insects. In particular, Sex-lethal, the key gene that controls sexual differentiation in Drosophila, does not have a sex-determining function in any other genus studied so far. These results show that sex-determining cascades, in comparison to other regulatory pathways, evolve much more rapidly.},

HIV treatment drug regimen efficacies were from clinical guidelines and published sources; data on other drugs used were not available. In a computer simulation model, we projected HIV medical care costs in 2004 U.S. dollars.From the time of entering HIV care, per person projected life expectancy is 24.2 years, discounted lifetime cost is Dollars 385,200, and undiscounted cost is Dollars 618,900 for adults who initiate ART with CD4 cell count < 350/microL. Seventy-three percent of the cost is antiretroviral medications, 13\% inpatient care, 9\% outpatient care, and 5\% other HIV-related medications and laboratory costs. For patients who initiate ART with CD4 cell count < 200/microL, projected life expectancy is 22.5 years, discounted lifetime cost is Dollars 354,100 and undiscounted cost is Dollars 567,000. Results are sensitive to drug manufacturers' discounts, ART efficacy, and use of enfuvirtide for salvage. If costs are discounted to the time of infection, the discounted lifetime cost is Dollars 303,100.Effective ART regimens have substantially improved survival and have increased the lifetime cost of HIV-related medical care in the U.S.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent studies, subjects who had achieved suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA level while receiving an initial 3-drug antiretroviral regimen successfully maintained suppression while receiving treatment with a "boosted" protease inhibitor (PI) alone. We projected the long-term outcomes of this treatment simplification strategy to inform the design of a proposed multicenter, randomized clinical trial.We used published studies to estimate the efficacy, adverse effects, and cost of a sequence of HIV drug regimens for the simplification strategy, compared with those outcomes for the current standard-of-care (SOC) strategy. Using a published simulation model of HIV disease, we projected life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and discounted lifetime medical costs for each strategy.Subjects who have not developed PI-resistant HIV infection at the time of failure of the simplification regimen have a greater life expectancy (27.9 vs. 27.1 years) and QALE (14.9 vs. 14.7 years), compared with SOC subjects, because they receive an additional line of therapy without negative consequences for future treatment options. The QALE for the simplification strategy remains higher than that for the SOC, unless a large proportion of patients experiencing virologic failure while receiving the simplification regimen develop PI resistance. Depending on the probability of simplification regimen failure, the advantage is maintained even if HIV develops PI resistance in 42\%-70\% of subjects. Projected lifetime costs are $26,500-$72,400 per person lower for the simplification strategy than for the SOC strategy.An HIV treatment simplification strategy involving use of a boosted PI alone may lead to longer survival overall at lower cost, compared with the SOC combination therapy, because the simplification strategy potentially adds an additional line of therapy. The risk of emergence of PI resistance during treatment with a simplified regimen is a critical determinant of the viability of this strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {Lentiviruses such as HIV-1 traverse nuclear pore complexes (NPC) and infect terminally differentiated non-dividing cells, but how they do this is unclear. The cytoplasmic NPC protein Nup358/RanBP2 was identified as an HIV-1 co-factor in previous studies. Here we report that HIV-1 capsid (CA) binds directly to the cyclophilin domain of Nup358/RanBP2. Fusion of the Nup358/RanBP2 cyclophilin (Cyp) domain to the tripartite motif of TRIM5 created a novel inhibitor of HIV-1 replication, consistent with an interaction in vivo. In contrast to CypA binding to HIV-1 CA, Nup358 binding is insensitive to inhibition with cyclosporine, allowing contributions from CypA and Nup358 to be distinguished. Inhibition of CypA reduced dependence on Nup358 and the nuclear basket protein Nup153, suggesting that CypA regulates the choice of the nuclear import machinery that is engaged by the virus. HIV-1 cyclophilin-binding mutants CA G89V and P90A favored integration in genomic regions with a higher density of transcription units and associated features than wild type virus. Integration preference of wild type virus in the presence of cyclosporine was similarly altered to regions of higher transcription density. In contrast, HIV-1 CA alterations in another patch on the capsid surface that render the virus less sensitive to Nup358 or TRN-SR2 depletion (CA N74D, N57A) resulted in integration in genomic regions sparse in transcription units. Both groups of CA mutants are impaired in replication in HeLa cells and human monocyte derived macrophages. Our findings link HIV-1 engagement of cyclophilins with both integration targeting and replication efficiency and provide insight into the conservation of viral cyclophilin recruitment.},

We analyzed the role of these proteins in the splicing of a substrate derived from the HIV-1 tat gene and have shown that hnRNP H family members are required for efficient splicing of this substrate. The hnRNP H protein family members activated splicing of the viral substrate by promoting the formation of ATP-dependent spliceosomal complexes. Mutational analysis of six consensus motifs present within the intron of the substrate indicated that only one of these motifs acts as an intronic splicing enhancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Antiretroviral compounds have been predominantly studied in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B, but only ~10\% of infections worldwide are caused by this subtype. The analysis of the impact of different HIV subtypes on treatment outcome is important.The effect of HIV-1 subtype B and non-B on the time to virological failure while taking combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was analyzed. Other studies that have addressed this question were limited by the strong correlation between subtype and ethnicity. Our analysis was restricted to white patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study who started cART between 1996 and 2009. Cox regression models were performed; adjusted for age, sex, transmission category, first cART, baseline CD4 cell counts, and HIV RNA levels; and stratified for previous mono/dual nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor treatment.Included in our study were 4729 patients infected with subtype B and 539 with non-B subtypes. The most prevalent non-B subtypes were CRF02_AG (23.8\%), A (23.4\%), C (12.8\%), and CRF01_AE (12.6\%). The incidence of virological failure was higher in patients with subtype B (4.3 failures/100 person-years; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-4.5]) compared with non-B (1.8 failures/100 person-years; 95\% CI, 1.4-2.4). Cox regression models confirmed that patients infected with non-B subtypes had a lower risk of virological failure than those infected with subtype B (univariable hazard ratio [HR], 0.39 [95\% CI, .30-.52; P < .001]; multivariable HR, 0.68 [95\% CI, .51-.91; P = .009]). In particular, subtypes A and CRF02_AG revealed improved outcomes (multivariable HR, 0.54 [95\% CI, .29-.98] and 0.39 [95\% CI, .19-.79], respectively).Improved virological outcomes among patients infected with non-B subtypes invalidate concerns that these individuals are at a disadvantage because drugs have been designed primarily for subtype B infections.},

  Abstract                 = {High-level immune activation and T cell apoptosis represent a hallmark of HIV-1 infection that is absent from nonpathogenic SIV infections in natural primate hosts. The mechanisms causing these varying levels of immune activation are not understood. Here, we report that nef alleles from the great majority of primate lentiviruses, including HIV-2, downmodulate TCR-CD3 from infected T cells, thereby blocking their responsiveness to activation. In contrast, nef alleles from HIV-1 and a subset of closely related SIVs fail to downregulate TCR-CD3 and to inhibit cell death. Thus, Nef-mediated suppression of T cell activation is a fundamental property of primate lentiviruses that likely evolved to maintain viral persistence in the context of an intact host immune system. This function was lost during viral evolution in a lineage that gave rise to HIV-1 and may have predisposed the simian precursor of HIV-1 for greater pathogenicity in humans.},

Accumulation of drug resistance mutations (mainly V75I, F77L, K103N, F116Y, Q151M, and M184V) eventually resulted in a strain that was genotypically and phenotypically resistant to all tested ddNs and the majority of NNRTIs. However, the multidrug-resistant virus retained wild type sensitivities to drugs such as foscarnet, phosphonomethoxyethyl adenine, dextran sulfate, JM3100, saquinavir, and NNRTI TSAO-m3T. Drug-resistant isolates showed replication kinetics and infectivity in an in vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell system similar to those of the wild type isolate from the same patient. The multi-ddN-resistant isolate was not eliminated in a competition culture with the wild type isolate. Sequential therapy did not prevent the appearance of multidrug-resistant virus with a conserved replication rate.},

  Abstract                 = {To define genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns following prolonged therapy with the protease inhibitor ritonavir (ABT-538).Seven HIV-1-infected patients, all but one previously treated with dideoxynucleoside analogues (zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine), were treated for 1 year with ritonavir.Direct solid-phase sequencing of the protease gene starting from plasma derived viral RNA followed by comparison to phenotypic drug resistance data.The most frequent amino-acid substitutions occurring upon administration of the protease inhibitor were V82A/F (substrate binding site), I54V (flap region), A71V and L10I. Additional mutations found in more than one patient were I15V, M36I, I84V and I93L. Mutation L63P was found both in pre- and post-ritonavir samples. Phenotypic drug resistance assays confirmed resistance to ritonavir in post-treatment samples (approximately 170-fold) and showed cross-resistance to indinavir (approximately 30-fold) and partially to saquinavir (approximately fivefold). At 1 year of treatment, one patient without known resistance-associated mutations in the protease gene still showed a substantial rise in CD4 cell count accompanied by a more than 2.4 log decrease in RNA viral load. However, at week 78, mutations R8Q, E34K, R57K, L63P and I84V were detected and the treatment benefit was partially lost.Long-term treatment with ritonavir is associated with the emergence of multiple mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene. The mutations L10I, I54V, L63P, A71V, V82A/F and I84V correspond to known drug-resistance mutations for ritonavir and other protease inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance to ritonavir was detected in a majority of ritonavir-treated patients at 1 year of treatment. In addition, long-term ritonavir treatment selects for cross-resistance to the protease inhibitors indinavir and saquinavir. This argues against sequential therapy with several protease inhibitors. Delayed resistance in one patient was accompanied with a prolonged increase in CD4 cell count and decrease in viral load suggesting a temporary benefit of treatment.},

Dscam binds directly to both Dock's SH2 and SH3 domains. Genetic studies revealed that Dscam, Dock and Pak, a serine/threonine kinase, act together to direct pathfinding of Bolwig's nerve, containing a subclass of sensory axons, to an intermediate target in the embryo. Dscam also is required for the formation of axon pathways in the embryonic central nervous system. cDNA and genomic analyses reveal the existence of multiple forms of Dscam with a conserved architecture containing variable Ig and transmembrane domains. Alternative splicing can potentially generate more than 38,000 Dscam isoforms. This molecular diversity may contribute to the specificity of neuronal connectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The positioning of nucleosomes with respect to DNA plays an important role in regulating transcription. However, nucleosome mapping has been performed for only limited genomic regions in humans. We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in both resting and activated human CD4+ T cells by direct sequencing of nucleosome ends using the Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique. We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-containing and modified nucleosomes are preferentially lost from the -1 nucleosome position. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the nucleosome landscape and its dynamic regulation in the human genome.},

  Abstract                 = {Small virus-derived interfering RNAs (viRNAs) play an important role in antiviral defence in plants, insects and nematodes by triggering the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. The role of RNAi as an antiviral defence mechanism in mammalian cells has been obscure due to the lack of viRNA detection. Although viRNAs from different mammalian viruses have recently been identified, their functions and possible impact on viral replication remain unknown. To identify viRNAs derived from HIV-1, we used the extremely sensitive SOLiD(TM) 3 Plus System to analyse viRNA accumulation in HIV-1-infected T lymphocytes. We detected numerous small RNAs that correspond to the HIV-1 RNA genome. The majority of these sequences have a positive polarity (98.1\%) and could be derived from miRNAs encoded by structured segments of the HIV-1 RNA genome (vmiRNAs). A small portion of the viRNAs is of negative polarity and most of them are encoded within the 3'-UTR, which may represent viral siRNAs (vsiRNAs). The identified vsiRNAs can potently repress HIV-1 production, whereas suppression of the vsiRNAs by antagomirs stimulate virus production. These results suggest that HIV-1 triggers the production of vsiRNAs and vmiRNAs to modulate cellular and/or viral gene expression.},

Here we describe mapping of 524 sites of HIV cDNA integration on the human genome sequence. Genes were found to be strongly favored as integration acceptor sites. Global analysis of cellular transcription indicated that active genes were preferential integration targets, particularly genes that were activated in cells after infection by HIV-1. Regional hotspots for integration were also found, including a 2.4 kb region containing 1\% of sites. These data document unexpectedly strong biases in integration site selection and suggest how selective targeting promotes aggressive HIV replication.},

In this report we examine the bioactivity of Nef in primary CD4 T cells and, in particular, focus on the biochemical pathways known to be central to T cell activity. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway was dramatically affected by Nef expression with increases in ERK, MEK, and Elk induction. The capacity of Nef to increase the MAP kinase pathway activity was dependent on T cell receptor stimulation. By increasing ERK MAP kinase activity, Nef is functionally associated with a kinase known to affect T cell activity, viral replication, and viral infectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Lentiviral Nef increases viral replication in vivo, plays a direct role in pathogenesis, and increases viral particle infectivity. We now find that HIV Nef also increases the activation of T cells, a cellular state required for optimal viral replication. This enhancement is stimulant-dependent. As defined by IL-2 generation, activation of T cells stimulated with classical mitogens [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) + anti-CD3, PMA + phytohemagglutinin, and PMA + ionomycin] is unaffected by the expression of Nef. However, Nef increases IL-2 secretion when cells are stimulated through the T cell receptor and the costimulus receptor (CD28). This increase in activation, which depends on Nef myristylation, is caused by an increase in the number of cells reaching full activation and not by an increase in the amount of IL-2 secreted per cell. These findings demonstrate that Nef lowers the threshold of the dual-receptor T cell activation pathway. The capacity of Nef to increase T cell activity may be very important in vivo when Nef is the predominant or the only viral gene product expressed.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of the appearance of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) on viral RNA load was studied in patients treated with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine. During the first 12 weeks of treatment, HIV-1 RNA concentrations and amino acid changes in codon 184, causing high-level resistance to lamivudine, were determined in longitudinal serum samples from HIV-1 p24 antigen-positive and -negative patients. A marked decline in the amount of HIV-1 RNA (approximately 95\% below baseline) and HIV-1 p24 antigen was observed within 2 weeks, followed by a rise that coincided with the appearance of lamivudine-resistant viruses in serum (isoleucine mutants initially, which were subsequently replaced by valine variants). After 12 weeks, a partial antiviral effect was observed despite the presence of a complete codon 184 mutant virus population in serum. This study shows that the rapid appearance of drug-resistant virus in serum is followed by an increase in viral RNA load.},

We have observed that this phenomenon depends on the expression of Nef. nef is an early gene of primate lentiviruses, which is necessary for maintaining high virus loads and inducing AIDS. Nef is not necessary for viral replication in vitro and stimulates the endocytosis of CD4. We show that the expression of MHC-I at the surface of lymphoid, monocytic and epithelial cells was reduced in the presence of Nef protein from various HIV-1 strains. Whereas MHC-I protein synthesis and transport through the endoplasmic reticulum and cis Golgi apparatus occurred normally in Nef(+) cells, surface MHC-I molecules were rapidly internalized, accumulated in endosomal vesicles and were degraded. The stimulation of MHC-I endocytosis by Nef represents a previously undocumented viral mechanism for evading the immune response.},

The class of small mRNAs included 12 mRNAs expressing Tat, Rev, and Nef. In addition, HIV-1 produced other multiply spliced mRNAs that used alternative splice sites identified by cloning and sequencing. All of these mRNAs were found in the cytoplasm and should be able to produce additional proteins. The coding capacity of the tat, rev, and nef mRNAs was analyzed by transfection of the cloned cDNAs into human cells. The tat mRNAs produced high levels of Tat, but very low levels of Rev and Nef. All the rev mRNAs expressed high levels of both Rev and Nef and were essential for the production of sufficient amounts of Rev. Therefore, HIV-1 uses both alternatively spliced and bicistronic mRNAs for the production of Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins.},

By analysis of genome-wide nucleosome-positioning data sets from humans, flies and worms, we found that exons show increased nucleosome-occupancy levels with respect to introns, a finding that we link to differential GC content and nucleosome-disfavoring elements between exons and introns. Analysis of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data in humans and mice revealed four specific post-translational histone modifications enriched in exons. Our findings indicate that previously described enrichment of H3K36me3 modifications in exons reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, namely increased nucleosome occupancy along exons. Our results suggest an RNA polymerase II-mediated cross-talk between chromatin structure and exon-intron architecture, implying that exon selection may be modulated by chromatin structure.},

  Abstract                 = {We have used in vitro mutagenesis to explore the functions of the gene products encoded by the pol gene of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). Deletions were constructed at a variety of positions in the gene, and the altered DNA copies of the viral genome were introduced into mouse cells by cotransformation. The mutants could be divided into two classes depending on the phenotype and map position of the deletion within the pol gene. Mutants with deletions mapping in the 5' portion of the gene were found to be completely deficient in reverse transcriptase activity. Mutants mapping in the 3' portion of the gene, however, assembled and released virions with normal levels of reverse transcriptase and RNAase H activities. When applied to permissive cells, these virions directed the synthesis of all three forms of unintegrated viral DNA: full-length, double-stranded linear DNA and the two circular forms with one and two copies of the long terminal repeat sequences. The infection was arrested at this point and the infected cells did not become producers of virus. Thus the 3' portion of the pol gene encodes a polypeptide with a function distinct from that of reverse transcriptase, which is not required for synthesis of viral DNA but is essential for establishment of that DNA in a stable, active form in the infected cell. We suggest that this function may be the integration of the proviral DNA.},

As part of our ongoing search for active and possibly disease-relevant human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), we have recently developed an oligonucleotide-based microarray. The assay allows for both the detection and the identification of most known retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT)-related nucleic acids in biological samples. In the present study, we have investigated the transcriptional activity of representative members of 20 HERV families in 19 different normal human tissues. Qualitative evaluation of chip hybridization signals and quantitative analysis by real-time RT-PCR revealed distinct HERV activity in the human tissues under investigation, suggesting that HERV elements are active in human cells in a tissue-specific manner. Most active members of HERV families were found in mRNA prepared from skin, thyroid gland, placenta, and tissues of reproductive organs. In contrast, only few active HERVs were detectable in muscle cells. Human tissues that lack HERV transcription could not be found, confirming that human endogenous retroviruses are permanent components of the human transcriptome. Distinct activity patterns may reflect the characteristics of the regulatory machinery in these cells, e.g., cell type-dependent occurrence of transcriptional regulatory factors.},

OF testing was conducted in parallel with whole blood-based testing according to the national HIV algorithm. Blood samples were collected as dried blood spot (DBS) specimens from all participants for quality assurance. HIV infection results were delivered according to the national algorithm. According to the national HIV algorithm, 512 (30.5\%) samples were reactive, 1,151 (68.7\%) were nonreactive, and 13 (0.8\%) were discordant. All discordant cases were retested with an enzyme immunoassay followed by Western blotting, and five (38.5\%) were confirmed as HIV positive. The OraQuick OF test showed 518 (30.9\%) reactive samples and 1,158 (69.1\%) nonreactive samples, with a sensitivity and specificity of 99.8\% and 99.8\%, respectively. The Chembio DPP OF test showed 519 (31.0\%) reactive samples and 1,157 (69.0\%) nonreactive samples with a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 99.8\%, respectively. The participants perceived blood testing (49.9\%) to be more accurate than OF testing (46.8\%).

  Abstract                 = {Eight percent of the human genome is composed of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which are thought to be inactive remnants of ancient infections. Previously, we showed that individuals with early HIV-1 infection have stronger anti-HERV T cell responses than uninfected controls. In this study, we investigated whether these responses persist in chronic HIV-1 infection and whether they have a role in the control of HIV-1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 88 subjects diagnosed with HIV-1 infection for at least 1 year (median duration of diagnosis, 13 years) were tested for responses against HERV peptides in gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. Individuals who control HIV-1 viremia without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had stronger and broader HERV-specific T cell responses than HAART-suppressed patients, virologic noncontrollers, immunologic progressors, and uninfected controls (P < 0.05 for each pairwise comparison). In addition, the magnitude of the anti-HERV T cell response was inversely correlated with HIV-1 viral load (r(2) = 0.197, P = 0.0002) and associated with higher CD4(+) T cell counts (r(2) = 0.072, P = 0.027) in untreated patients. Flow cytometric analyses of an HLA-B51-restricted CD8(+) HERV response in one HIV-1-infected individual revealed a less activated and more differentiated phenotype than that stimulated by a homologous HIV-1 peptide. HLA-B51 tetramer dual staining within this individual confirmed two different T cell populations corresponding to these HERV and HIV-1 epitopes, ruling out cross-reactivity. These findings suggest a possible role for anti-HERV immunity in the control of chronic HIV-1 infection and provide support for a larger effort to design an HIV-1 vaccine that targets conserved antigens such as HERV.},

  Abstract                 = {The autonomous transcription of integrated retroviruses strongly depends on genetic and epigenetic effects of the chromatin at the site of integration. These effects are mostly suppressive and proviral activity can be finally silenced by mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. To address the role of the integration site at the whole-genome-scale, we performed clonal analysis of provirus silencing with an avian leucosis/sarcoma virus-based reporter vector and correlated the transcriptional silencing with the epigenomic landscape of respective integrations. We demonstrate efficient provirus silencing in human HCT116 cell line, which is strongly but not absolutely dependent on the de novo DNA methyltransferase activity, particularly of Dnmt3b. Proviruses integrated close to the transcription start sites of active genes into the regions enriched in H3K4 trimethylation display long-term stability of expression and are resistant to the transcriptional silencing after over-expression of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b. In contrast, proviruses in the intergenic regions tend to spontaneous transcriptional silencing even in Dnmt3a(-/-) Dnmt3b(-/-) cells. The silencing of proviruses within genes is accompanied with DNA methylation of long terminal repeats, whereas silencing in intergenic regions is DNA methylation-independent. These findings indicate that the epigenomic features of integration sites are crucial for their permissivity to the proviral expression.},

  Abstract                 = {The SF1 helicase MOV10 is an antiviral factor that is incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. We now report that HIV-1 virions also incorporate UPF1, which belongs to the same SF1 helicase subfamily as MOV10 and functions in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Unlike ectopic MOV10, the overexpression of UPF1 does not impair the infectivity of HIV-1 progeny virions. However, UPF1 becomes a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 progeny virion infectivity when residues required for its helicase activity are mutated. In contrast, equivalent mutations abolish the antiviral activity of MOV10. Importantly, cells depleted of endogenous UPF1, but not of another NMD core component, produce HIV-1 virions of substantially lower specific infectivity. The defect is at the level of reverse transcription, the same stage of the HIV-1 life cycle inhibited by ectopic MOV10. Thus, whereas ectopic MOV10 restricts HIV-1 replication, the related UPF1 helicase functions as a cofactor at an early postentry step.},

  Abstract                 = {As glucose-induced insulin expression is mainly regulated at the translational level, and such regulation often involves the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), we examined the human proinsulin gene 5'UTR. RT-PCR and sequencing demonstrated that a proinsulin splice variant (SPV) generated from a cryptic 5'-splice site and retaining the first 26 bp of intron 1 was present in human pancreatic islets from normal donors. The expression of this SPV was metabolically regulated, as shown by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, revealing a more than 10-fold increase in the SPV in isolated human islets incubated at 16.7 mM compared with 1.67 mM glucose. In vitro wheat-germ translation and in vivom transfection studies demonstrated that the altered 5'UTR of the SPV increased translation. The SPV yielded 4-fold more in vitro translated preproinsulin protein than the native proinsulin mRNA, and the SPV 5'UTR inserted upstream from a luciferase reporter gene resulted in a more than 6-fold higher luciferase activity, suggesting enhanced translation in vivo. Retention of the 26 bp changed the proposed secondary RNA structure of the SPV, which may facilitate ribosomal binding and explain the increase in translation efficiency. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which metabolic changes can modulate the expression of 5'UTR SPVs and thereby regulate translation efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV-1 replication but cannot eliminate the virus because HIV-1 establishes latent infection. Interruption of HAART leads to a rapid rebound of viremia, so life-long treatment is required. Efforts to purge the latent reservoir have focused on reactivating latent proviruses without inducing global T cell activation. However, the killing of the infected cells after virus reactivation, which is essential for elimination of the reservoir, has not been assessed. Here we show that after reversal of latency in an in vitro model, infected resting CD4(+) T cells survived despite viral cytopathic effects, even in the presence of autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from most patients on HAART. Antigen-specific stimulation of patient CTLs led to efficient killing of infected cells. These results demonstrate that stimulating HIV-1-specific CTLs prior to reactivating latent HIV-1 may be essential for successful eradication efforts and should be considered in future clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) establishes a latent reservoir in resting memory CD4(+) T cells. This latent reservoir is a major barrier to the eradication of HIV-1 in infected individuals and is not affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Reactivation of latent HIV-1 is a possible strategy for elimination of this reservoir. The mechanisms with which latency is maintained are unclear. In the analysis of the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression, it is important to consider the nature of HIV-1 integration sites. In this study, we analyzed the integration and transcription of latent HIV-1 in a primary CD4(+) T cell model of latency. The majority of integration sites in latently infected cells were in introns of transcription units. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) demonstrated that more than 90\% of those host genes harboring a latent integrated provirus were transcriptionally active, mostly at high levels. For latently infected cells, we observed a modest preference for integration in the same transcriptional orientation as the host gene (63.8\% versus 36.2\%). In contrast, this orientation preference was not observed in acutely infected or persistently infected cells. These results suggest that transcriptional interference may be one of the important factors in the establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 latency. Our findings suggest that disrupting the negative control of HIV-1 transcription by upstream host promoters could facilitate the reactivation of latent HIV-1 in some resting CD4(+) T cells.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the development of AIDS, we studied the evolution of the C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env gene and of T-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. They were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the CXCR4 receptor (X4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases ( approximately 1\% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in CD3(+) T cells) and decline of CD4(+) T cells to </=200 cells/microliter. The strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and T-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of HIV-1 infection in moderate progressors. Recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated HIV-1 infections.},

  Abstract                 = {454 sequencing technology is a promising approach for characterizing HIV-1 populations and for identifying low frequency mutations. The utility of 454 technology for determining allele frequencies and linkage associations in HIV infected individuals has not been extensively investigated. We evaluated the performance of 454 sequencing for characterizing HIV populations with defined allele frequencies.We constructed two HIV-1 RT clones. Clone A was a wild type sequence. Clone B was identical to clone A except it contained 13 introduced drug resistant mutations. The clones were mixed at ratios ranging from 1\% to 50\% and were amplified by standard PCR conditions and by PCR conditions aimed at reducing PCR-based recombination. The products were sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing. Sequence analysis from standard PCR amplification revealed that 14\% of all sequencing reads from a sample with a 50:50 mixture of wild type and mutant DNA were recombinants. The majority of the recombinants were the result of a single crossover event which can happen during PCR when the DNA polymerase terminates synthesis prematurely. The incompletely extended template then competes for primer sites in subsequent rounds of PCR. Although less often, a spectrum of other distinct crossover patterns was also detected. In addition, we observed point mutation errors ranging from 0.01\% to 1.0\% per base as well as indel (insertion and deletion) errors ranging from 0.02\% to nearly 50\%. The point errors (single nucleotide substitution errors) were mainly introduced during PCR while indels were the result of pyrosequencing. We then used new PCR conditions designed to reduce PCR-based recombination. Using these new conditions, the frequency of recombination was reduced 27-fold. The new conditions had no effect on point mutation errors. We found that 454 pyrosequencing was capable of identifying minority HIV-1 mutations at frequencies down to 0.1\% at some nucleotide positions.Standard PCR amplification results in a high frequency of PCR-introduced recombination precluding its use for linkage analysis of HIV populations using 454 pyrosequencing. We designed a new PCR protocol that resulted in a much lower recombination frequency and provided a powerful technique for linkage analysis and haplotype determination in HIV-1 populations. Our analyses of 454 sequencing results also demonstrated that at some specific HIV-1 drug resistant sites, mutations can reliably be detected at frequencies down to 0.1\%.},

Nucleotide frequencies obtained for the highly conserved regions around the splice sites for different categories of organisms closely agree with each other. A striking similarity among the rare splice junctions which do not contain AG at the 3' splice site or GT at the 5' splice site indicates the existence of special mechanisms to recognize them, and that these unique signals may be involved in crucial gene-regulation events and in differentiation. A method was developed to predict potential exons in a bare sequence, using a scoring and ranking scheme based on nucleotide weight tables. This method was used to find a majority of the exons in selected known genes, and also predicted potential new exons which may be used in alternative splicing situations.},

  Abstract                 = {In the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, molecular evolutionary studies of primate lentiviruses provide the most definitive information about the origins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2. Related lentiviruses have been found infecting numerous species of primates in sub-Saharan Africa. The only species naturally infected with viruses closely related to HIV-2 is the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) from western Africa, the region where HIV-2 is known to be endemic. Similarly, the only viruses very closely related to HIV-1 have been isolated from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and in particular those from western equatorial Africa, again coinciding with the region that appears to be the hearth of the HIV-1 pandemic. HIV-1 and HIV-2 have each arisen several times: in the case of HIV-1, the three groups (M, N and O) are the result of independent cross-species transmission events. Consistent with the phylogenetic position of a 'fossil' virus from 1959, molecular clock analyses using realistic models of HIV-1 sequence evolution place the last common ancestor of the M group prior to 1940, and several lines of evidence indicate that the jump from chimpanzees to humans occurred before then. Both the inferred geographical origin of HIV-1 and the timing of the cross-species transmission are inconsistent with the suggestion that oral polio vaccines, putatively contaminated with viruses from chimpanzees in eastern equatorial Africa in the late 1950s, could be responsible for the origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.},

  Abstract                 = {Viruses have developed diverse non-immune strategies to counteract host-mediated mechanisms that confer resistance to infection. The Vif (virion infectivity factor) proteins are encoded by primate immunodeficiency viruses, most notably human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). These proteins are potent regulators of virus infection and replication and are consequently essential for pathogenic infections in vivo. HIV-1 Vif seems to be required during the late stages of virus production for the suppression of an innate antiviral phenotype that resides in human T lymphocytes. Thus, in the absence of Vif, expression of this phenotype renders progeny virions non-infectious. Here, we describe a unique cellular gene, CEM15, whose transient or stable expression in cells that do not normally express CEM15 recreates this phenotype, but whose antiviral action is overcome by the presence of Vif. Because the Vif:CEM15 regulatory circuit is critical for HIV-1 replication, perturbing the circuit may be a promising target for future HIV/AIDS therapies.},

  Abstract                 = {The human protein apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like-3G (APOBEC3G), also known as CEM-15, mediates a newly described form of innate resistance to retroviral infection by catalyzing the deamination of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine in viral cDNA replication intermediates. Because DNA deamination takes place after virus entry into target cells, APOBEC3G function is dependent on its association with the viral nucleoprotein complexes that synthesize cDNA and must therefore be incorporated into virions as they assemble in infected cells. Here we show that the HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein protects the virus from APOBEC3G-mediated inactivation by preventing its incorporation into progeny virions, thus allowing the ensuing infection to proceed without DNA deamination. In addition to helping exclude APOBEC3G from nascent virions, Vif also removes APOBEC3G from virus-producing cells by inducing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Our findings indicate that pharmacologic strategies aimed at stabilizing APOBEC3G in HIV-1 infected cells should be explored as potential HIV/AIDS therapeutics.},

  Abstract                 = {The Alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution. Thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from Alu elements. However, identifying Alu exons that have acquired genuine biological functions remains a major challenge. We investigated the creation and establishment of Alu exons in human genes, using transcriptome profiles of human tissues generated by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with extensive RT-PCR analysis. More than 25\% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50\% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes. Genes encoding zinc finger transcription factors have significantly higher levels of Alu exonization. Importantly, Alu exons with high splicing activities are strongly enriched in the 5'-UTR, and two-thirds (10/15) of 5'-UTR Alu exons tested by luciferase reporter assays significantly alter mRNA translational efficiency. Mutational analysis reveals the specific molecular mechanisms by which newly created 5'-UTR Alu exons modulate translational efficiency, such as the creation or elongation of upstream ORFs that repress the translation of the primary ORFs. This study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation. Moreover, the preferential creation and establishment of Alu exons in zinc finger genes suggest that Alu exonization may have globally affected the evolution of primate and human transcriptomes by regulating the protein production of master transcriptional regulators in specific lineages.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultra-deep RNA sequencing has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We develop MATS (multivariate analysis of transcript splicing), a Bayesian statistical framework for flexible hypothesis testing of differential alternative splicing patterns on RNA-Seq data. MATS uses a multivariate uniform prior to model the between-sample correlation in exon splicing patterns, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive sampling procedure to calculate the P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) of differential alternative splicing. Importantly, the MATS approach is applicable to almost any type of null hypotheses of interest, providing the flexibility to identify differential alternative splicing events that match a given user-defined pattern. We evaluated the performance of MATS using simulated and real RNA-Seq data sets. In the RNA-Seq analysis of alternative splicing events regulated by the epithelial-specific splicing factor ESRP1, we obtained a high RT-PCR validation rate of 86\% for differential exon skipping events with a MATS FDR of <10\%. Additionally, over the full list of RT-PCR tested exons, the MATS FDR estimates matched well with the experimental validation rate. Our results demonstrate that MATS is an effective and flexible approach for detecting differential alternative splicing from RNA-Seq data.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate identification of genetic variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is essential for immediate large-scale genomic endeavors such as the 1000 Genomes Project, and is crucial for further genetic analysis based on the discoveries. The key challenge in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery is to distinguish true individual variants (occurring at a low frequency) from sequencing errors (often occurring at frequencies orders of magnitude higher). Therefore, knowledge of the error probabilities of base calls is essential. We have developed Atlas-SNP2, a computational tool that detects and accounts for systematic sequencing errors caused by context-related variables in a logistic regression model learned from training data sets. Subsequently, it estimates the posterior error probability for each substitution through a Bayesian formula that integrates prior knowledge of the overall sequencing error probability and the estimated SNP rate with the results from the logistic regression model for the given substitutions. The estimated posterior SNP probability can be used to distinguish true SNPs from sequencing errors. Validation results show that Atlas-SNP2 achieves a false-positive rate of lower than 10\%, with an approximately 5\% or lower false-negative rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary: Clearcut is an open source implementation for the relaxed neighbor joining (RNJ) algorithm. While traditional neighbor joining (NJ) remains a popular method for distance-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction, it suffers from a O(N3) time complexity, where N represents the number of taxa in the input. Due to this steep asymptotic time complexity, NJ cannot reasonably handle very large datasets. In contrast, RNJ realizes a typical-case time complexity on the order of N2logN without any significant qualitative difference in output. RNJ is particularly useful when inferring a very large tree or a large number of trees. In addition, RNJ retains the desirable property that it will always reconstruct the true tree given a matrix of additive pairwise distances. Clearcut implements RNJ as a C program, which takes either a set of aligned sequences or a pre-computed distance matrix as input and produces a phylogenetic tree. Alternatively, Clearcut can reconstruct phylogenies using an extremely fast standard NJ implementation.

  Abstract                 = {Alternative polyadenylation (APA) of mRNAs has emerged as an important mechanism for post-transcriptional gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. Although microarrays have recently been used to characterize APA globally, they have a number of serious limitations that prevents comprehensive and highly quantitative analysis. To better characterize APA and its regulation, we have developed a deep sequencing-based method called Poly(A) Site Sequencing (PAS-Seq) for quantitatively profiling RNA polyadenylation at the transcriptome level. PAS-Seq not only accurately and comprehensively identifies poly(A) junctions in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs, but also provides quantitative information on the relative abundance of polyadenylated RNAs. PAS-Seq analyses of human and mouse transcriptomes showed that 40\%-50\% of all expressed genes produce alternatively polyadenylated mRNAs. Furthermore, our study detected evolutionarily conserved polyadenylation of histone mRNAs and revealed novel features of mitochondrial RNA polyadenylation. Finally, PAS-Seq analyses of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural stem/progenitor (NSP) cells, and neurons not only identified more poly(A) sites than what was found in the entire mouse EST database, but also detected significant changes in the global APA profile that lead to lengthening of 3' untranslated regions (UTR) in many mRNAs during stem cell differentiation. Together, our PAS-Seq analyses revealed a complex landscape of RNA polyadenylation in mammalian cells and the dynamic regulation of APA during stem cell differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, which identifies exons and removes intervening introns. Alternative splicing in higher eukaryotes results in the generation of multiple protein isoforms from gene transcripts. The extensive alternative splicing observed implies a flexibility of the spliceosome to identify exons within a given pre-mRNA. To reach this flexibility, splice-site selection in higher eukaryotes has evolved to depend on multiple parameters such as splice-site strength, splicing regulators, the exon/intron architecture, and the process of pre-mRNA synthesis itself. RNA secondary structures have also been proposed to influence alternative splicing as stable RNA secondary structures that mask splice sites are expected to interfere with splice-site recognition. Using structural and functional conservation, we identified RNA structure elements within the human genome that associate with alternative splice-site selection. Their frequent involvement with alternative splicing demonstrates that RNA structure formation is an important mechanism regulating gene expression and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV infection can be treated effectively with antiretroviral agents, but the persistence of a latent reservoir of integrated proviruses prevents eradication of HIV from infected individuals. The chromosomal environment of integrated proviruses has been proposed to influence HIV latency, but the determinants of transcriptional repression have not been fully clarified, and it is unclear whether the same molecular mechanisms drive latency in different cell culture models.Here we compare data from five different in vitro models of latency based on primary human T cells or a T cell line. Cells were infected in vitro and separated into fractions containing proviruses that were either expressed or silent/inducible, and integration site populations sequenced from each. We compared the locations of 6,252 expressed proviruses to those of 6,184 silent/inducible proviruses with respect to 140 forms of genomic annotation, many analyzed over chromosomal intervals of multiple lengths. A regularized logistic regression model linking proviral expression status to genomic features revealed no predictors of latency that performed better than chance, though several genomic features were significantly associated with proviral expression in individual models. Proviruses in the same chromosomal region did tend to share the same expressed or silent/inducible status if they were from the same cell culture model, but not if they were from different models.The silent/inducible phenotype appears to be associated with chromosomal position, but the molecular basis is not fully clarified and may differ among in vitro models of latency.},

We have also found new examples of rare splice-site categories, such as U12-type introns without canonical borders, and U2-dependent AT-AC introns. The splice-site sequences and several tools to explore them are available on a public website (SpliceRack). For the U12-type introns, we find several features conserved across species, as well as a clustering of these introns on genes. Using the information content of the splice-site motifs, and the phylogenetic distance between them, we identify: (i) a higher degree of conservation in the exonic portion of the U2-type splice sites in more complex organisms; (ii) conservation of exonic nucleotides for U12-type splice sites; (iii) divergent evolution of C.elegans 3' splice sites (3'ss) and (iv) distinct evolutionary histories of 5' and 3'ss. Our study proves that the identification of broad patterns in naturally-occurring splice sites, through the analysis of genomic datasets, provides mechanistic and evolutionary insights into pre-mRNA splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been assumed that RNA packaging constraints limit the size of retroviral genomes. This notion of a retroviral "headful" was tested by examining the ability of Moloney murine leukemia virus genomes lengthened by 4, 8, or 11 kb to participate in a single replication cycle. Overall, replication of these lengthened genomes was 5- to 10-fold less efficient than that of native-length genomes. When RNA expression and virion formation, RNA packaging, and early stages of replication were compared, long genomes were found to complete each step less efficiently than did normal-length genomes. To test whether short RNAs might facilitate the packaging of lengthy RNAs by heterodimerization, some experiments involved coexpression of a short packageable RNA. However, enhancement of neither long vector RNA packaging nor long vector DNA synthesis was observed in the presence of the short RNA. Most of the proviruses templated by 12 and 16 kb vectors appeared to be full length. Most products of a 19. 2-kb vector contained deletions, but some integrated proviruses were around twice the native genome length. These results demonstrate that lengthy retroviral genomes can be packaged and that genome length is not strictly limited at any individual replication step. These observations also suggest that the lengthy read-through RNAs postulated to be intermediates in retroviral transduction can be packaged directly without further processing.},

By analyzing four libraries (brain, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum), we redefined more accurately the TSPs of 11-27\% of the analyzed transcriptional units that were hit. The frequency of CAGE tags correlates well with results from other analyses, such as serial analysis of gene expression, and furthermore maps the TSPs more accurately, including in tissue-specific cases. The high-throughput nature of this technology paves the way for understanding gene networks via correlation of promoter usage and gene transcriptional factor expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent data shows that HIV-1 is characterised by variation in viral virulence factors that is heritable between infections, which suggests that viral virulence can be naturally selected at the population level. A trade-off between transmissibility and duration of infection appears to favour viruses of intermediate virulence. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of putative viral genotypes that differ in their virulence. As a proxy for virulence, we use set-point viral load (SPVL), which is the steady density of viral particles in blood during asymptomatic infection. Mutation, the dependency of survival and transmissibility on SPVL, and host effects were incorporated into the model. The model was fitted to data to estimate unknown parameters, and was found to fit existing data well. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters produced a model in which SPVL converged from any initial conditions to observed values within 100-150 years of first emergence of HIV-1. We estimated the 1) host effect and 2) the extent to which the viral virulence genotype mutates from one infection to the next, and found a trade-off between these two parameters in explaining the variation in SPVL. The model confirms that evolution of virulence towards intermediate levels is sufficiently rapid for it to have happened in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and confirms that existing viral loads are nearly optimal given the assumed constraints on evolution. The model provides a useful framework under which to examine the future evolution of HIV-1 virulence.},

  Abstract                 = {The vpr gene from the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) encodes a 14-kDa protein that prevents cell proliferation by causing a block in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle. This cellular function of vpr is conserved in evolution because other primate lentiviruses, including HIV-2, SIV(mac), and SIV(agm) encode related genes that also induce G(2) arrest. After G(2) arrest, cells expressing vpr undergo apoptosis. The signaling pathways that result in vpr-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis have yet to be determined. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is involved in signaling pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a variety of cell types. In this work, we examine the potential role of p53 in mediating cell cycle block and/or apoptosis by HIV-1 vpr and demonstrate that both phenomena occur independently of the presence and function of p53. Caspases are common mediators of apoptosis. We examined the potential role of caspases in mediating vpr-induced apoptosis by treating vpr-expressing cells with Boc-D-FMK, a broad spectrum, irreversible inhibitor of the caspase family. Boc-D-FMK significantly reduced the numbers of apoptotic cells induced by vpr. Therefore, we conclude that vpr-induced apoptosis is effected via the activation of caspases.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has high replication and mutation rates that generate large census populations and high levels of genetic variation. We examined the roles of natural selection, population growth, random genetic drift, and recombination in shaping the variation in 1509 C2-V5 env sequences derived from nine men with chronic HIV-1 infection. These sequences were obtained from clinical visits that reflect the first 6-13.7 years of infection. Pairwise comparisons of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances, Tajima's D test, Fu and Li's D* test, and a test of recurrent mutation revealed evidence for episodes of nonneutral evolution in a total of 22 out of 145 blood samples, representing six of the nine individuals. Using three coalescent-based maximum-likelihood estimators, we found viral effective population sizes in all nine individuals to be approximately 10(3). We also show that a previous estimate of the effective population size of approximately 10(5) based on rare haplotype frequencies decreases to approximately 10(3) upon correcting a biased sampling procedure. We conclude that the genetic variation in these data sets can be explained by a predominance of random genetic drift of neutral mutations with brief episodes of natural selection that were frequently masked by recombination.},

  Abstract                 = {The nef genes of the human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and the related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) encode a protein (Nef) whose role in virus replication and cytopathicity remains uncertain. As an attempt to elucidate the function of nef, we characterized the nucleotide and corresponding protein sequences of naturally occurring nef genes obtained from several HIV-1-infected individuals. A consensus Nef sequence was derived and used to identify several features that were highly conserved among the Nef sequences. These features included a nearly invariant myristylation signal, regions of sequence polymorphism and variable duplication, a region with an acidic charge, a (Pxx)4 repeat sequence, and a potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site. Clustering of premature stop codons at position 124 was noted in 6 of the 54 Nef sequences. Further analysis revealed four stretches of residues that were highly conserved not only among the patient-derived HIV-1 Nef sequences, but also among the Nef sequences of HIV-2 and the SIVs, suggesting that Nef proteins expressed by these retroviruses are functionally equivalent. The "Nef-defining" sequences were used to evaluate the sequence alignments of known proteins reported to share sequence similarity with Nef sequences and to conduct additional computer-based searches for similar protein sequences. A gene encoding the consensus Nef sequence was also generated. This gene encodes a full-length Nef protein that should be a valuable tool in further studies of Nef function.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 can establish a state of latent infection at the level of individual T cells. Latently infected cells are rare in vivo and appear to arise when activated CD4(+) T cells, the major targets cells for HIV-1, become infected and survive long enough to revert back to a resting memory state, which is nonpermissive for viral gene expression. Because latent virus resides in memory T cells, it persists indefinitely even in patients on potent antiretroviral therapy. This latent reservoir is recognized as a major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection. The molecular mechanisms of latency are complex and include the absence in resting CD4(+) T cells of nuclear forms of key host transcription factors (e.g., NFκB and NFAT), the absence of Tat and associated host factors that promote efficient transcriptional elongation, epigenetic changes inhibiting HIV-1 gene expression, and transcriptional interference. The presence of a latent reservoir for HIV-1 helps explain the presence of very low levels of viremia in patients on antiretroviral therapy. These viruses are released from latently infected cells that have become activated and perhaps from other stable reservoirs but are blocked from additional rounds of replication by the drugs. Several approaches are under exploration for reactivating latent virus with the hope that this will allow elimination of the latent reservoir.},

  Abstract                 = {Fitness epistasis, the interaction among alleles at different loci in their effects on fitness, has potentially important consequences for adaptive evolution. We investigated fitness epistasis among amino acids of a functionally important region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exterior envelope glycoprotein (gp120). Seven mutations putatively involved in the adaptation of the second conserved to third variable protein region (C2-V3) to the use of an alternative host-cell chemokine coreceptor (CXCR4) for cell entry were engineered singly and in combinations on the wild-type genetic background and their effects on viral infectivity were measured. Epistasis was found to be common and complex, involving not only pairwise interactions, but also higher-order interactions. Interactions could also be surprisingly strong, changing fitness by more than 9 orders of magnitude, which is explained by some single mutations being practically lethal. A consequence of the observed epistasis is that many of the minimum-length mutational trajectories between the wild type and the mutant with highest fitness on cells expressing the alternative coreceptor are selectively inaccessible. These results may help explain the difficulty of evolving viruses that use the alternative coreceptor in culture and the delayed evolution of this phenotype in natural infection. Knowledge of common, complex, and strong fitness interactions among amino acids is necessary for a full understanding of protein evolution.},

Nef induces a transcriptional program in T cells that is 97\% identical to that of anti-CD3 T cell activation. This program is inhibited in the presence of cyclosporin. A requirement for TCR zeta and ZAP-70 is demonstrated for formation of the complete profile. Among eight factors particular to the anti-CD3 activation profile are IL16 and YY1, negative regulators of HIV transcription. In contrast, Nef exclusively upregulates factors positively regulating HIV, including Tat-SF1, U1 SNRNP, and IRF-2. New genes associated with Nef include CDK9, the induction of which enhances Tat function. Thus, Nef acts as a master switch early in the viral life cycle, forcing an environment conducive to dynamic viral production.},

  Abstract                 = {Many viruses, including retroviruses, undergo frequent recombination, a process which can increase their rate of adaptive evolution. In the case of HIV, recombination has been responsible for the generation of numerous intersubtype recombinant variants with epidemiological importance in the AIDS pandemic. Although it is known that fragments of genetic material do not combine randomly during the generation of recombinant viruses, the mechanisms that lead to preferential recombination at specific sites are not fully understood. Here we reanalyze recent independent data defining (i) the structure of a complete HIV-1 RNA genome and (ii) favorable sites for recombination. We show that in the absence of selection acting on recombinant genomes, regions harboring RNA structures in the NL4-3 model strain are strongly predictive of recombination breakpoints in the HIV-1 env genes of primary isolates. In addition, we found that breakpoints within recombinant HIV-1 genomes sampled from human populations, which have been acted upon extensively by natural selection, also colocalize with RNA structures. Critically, junctions between genes are enriched in structured RNA elements and are also preferred sites for generating functional recombinant forms. These data suggest that RNA structure-mediated recombination allows the virus to exchange intact genes rather than arbitrary subgene fragments, which is likely to increase the overall viability and replication success of the recombinant HIV progeny.},

To probe the regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of HIV-1, we analyze noise in gene-expression from HIV-1's long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter at different HIV-1 integration sites across the human genome. Flow cytometry analysis of GFP expression from the HIV-1 LTR shows high variability (noise) at each integration site. Notably, the measured noise levels are inconsistent with constitutive gene expression models. Instead, quantification of expression noise indicates that HIV-1 gene expression occurs through randomly timed bursts of activity from the LTR and that each burst generates an average of 2-10 mRNA transcripts before the promoter returns to an inactive state. These data indicate that transcriptional bursting can generate high variability in HIV-1 early gene products, which may critically influence the viral fate-decision between active replication and proviral latency.},

In this study, temporal changes of the expression levels of the complete human transcriptome, representing 47,000 well-characterized human transcripts, were monitored in the first 24 h during HIV-1 R5 and X4 exposition in resting primary CD4(+) T cells. We provide evidence that R5 viruses modulate, to a greater extent than X4 viruses, the level of mRNA of the resting CD4(+) T cells. Indeed, modulation of the TCR signaling and the actin organization involving the WAVE/ABI complex and the ARP2/3 complex appeared to be associated with R5 exposition. The data suggest that the ability of R5 viruses to modulate TCR-mediated actin polymerization and signaling creates a favorable environment for CD4(+) T cell activation after TCR stimulation and may partly explain why R5 is the primary strain observed early in the natural infection process.},

  Abstract                 = {Infection with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) has been consistently linked to Kaposi's sarcoma, but its mode of transmission, association with other cancers, and interaction with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are largely unknown.Between January 1992 and December 1997, we interviewed 3591 black patients with cancer in Johannesburg and Soweto, South Africa. Blood was tested for antibodies against HIV-1 and HHV-8 in 3344 of the patients. Antibodies against HHV-8 were detected with an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The intensity of the fluorescent signal correlated well with the titers of antibodies (P<0.001). The relations among the presence of anti-HHV-8 antibodies, sociodemographic and behavioral factors, type of cancer, and the presence or absence of coexistent HIV infection were examined with the use of unconditional logistic-regression models.Among the 3293 subjects with cancers other than Kaposi's sarcoma, the standardized seroprevalence of antibodies against HHV-8 was 32 percent, which did not differ significantly from the standardized seroprevalence among black blood donors. Among these 3293 patients, the prevalence of antibodies against HHV-8 increased with increasing age (P<0.001) and an increasing number of sexual partners (P=0.05) and decreased with increasing years of education (P=0.007); it was not strongly associated with HIV-1 infection. Anti-HHV-8 antibodies were more frequent among black than white blood donors (P<0.001). Among the 51 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, the standardized seroprevalence of antibodies against HHV-8 was 83 percent, significantly higher than the prevalence among those without Kaposi's sarcoma (P<0.001). For 16 other specific types of cancer, including multiple myeloma (108 cases) and prostate cancer (202 cases), the variation in the standardized seroprevalence of antibodies against HHV-8 was not remarkable. At a given intensity of fluorescence of anti-HHV-8 antibodies, Kaposi's sarcoma was more frequent among HIV-1-positive patients than among those who were HIV-1-negative (P<0.001).Among black patients with cancer in South Africa, the seroprevalence of anti-HHV-8 antibodies is high and is specifically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, particularly at high titers.},

Data were analyzed for the first 48 weeks of therapy (median follow-up, 40 weeks).Hematologic toxicity was significantly less frequent in patients who received zidovudine therapy every other week (11\% to 15\%) or every other month (11\% to 14\%) than in those who received continuous zidovudine therapy (33\%) (P < 0.02). Weekly alternating therapy with zidovudine and ddC, 0.03 mg/kg, or intermittent therapy with ddC, 0.03 mg/kg, produced high rates of peripheral neuropathy (41\% and 50\%, respectively). Neuropathy occurred in 10\% to 21\% of patients in the other three alternating-therapy limbs and in 17\% of patients receiving zidovudine alone (intermittently or continuously). Initial increases in CD4 cell counts were sustained in three alternating-therapy limbs, but counts returned to baseline by week 28 in the remaining limbs. The median weight gain at week 48 was significantly greater in patients treated with alternating regimens (0.9 to 3.8 kg) compared with those treated with continuous zidovudine therapy (-0.7 kg) (P = 0.008). Patients treated with alternating regimens and those treated with continuous zidovudine had similarly sustained decreases in p24 antigen levels.These findings suggest that alternating therapy with zidovudine and ddC reduces the toxicity associated with each drug alone while maintaining strong antiretroviral activity.},

Monthly HIV costs were stratified by CD4 cell count. Costs of CD4, HIV RNA and genotype tests and antiretroviral therapy (ART) were derived from published literature. Model inputs from national data included mean age 38 years, mean initial CD4 cell count 372 cells/μl, ART initiation at CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/μl, and ART regimen costs ranging from €760 to 2570 per month.The model projected a mean undiscounted life expectancy of 26.5 years and a lifetime undiscounted cost of €535,000/patient (€320,700 discounted); 73\% of costs were ART related. When patients presented to care with mean CD4 cell counts of 510 cells/μl and initiated ART at CD4 cell counts less than 500 cells/μl or HIV RNA more than 100,000 copies/ml, life expectancy was 27.4 years and costs increased 1-2\%, to €546,700 (€324,500 discounted). When we assumed introducing generic drugs would result in a 50\% decline in first-line ART costs, lifetime costs decreased 4-6\%, to €514,200 (€302 ,800 discounted).As HIV disease is treated earlier with more efficacious drugs, survival and thus costs of care will continue to increase. The availability in high-income countries of widely used antiretroviral drugs in generic form could reduce these costs.},

  Abstract                 = {The dipyridodiazepinone Nevirapine is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase (RT) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It is a member of an important class of nonnucleoside drugs that appear to share part or all of the same binding site on the enzyme but are susceptible to a variety of spontaneous drug-resistance mutations. The co-crystal-structure of HIV-1 RT and Nevirapine has been solved previously at 3.5-A resolution and now is partially refined against data extending to 2.9-A spacing. The drug is bound in a hydrophobic pocket and in contact with some 38 protein atoms from the p66 palm and thumb subdomains. Most, but not all, nonnucleoside drug-resistance mutations map to residues in close contact with Nevirapine. The major effects of these mutations are to introduce steric clashes with the drug molecule or to remove favorable protein-drug contacts. Additionally, four residues (Phe-227, Trp-229, Leu-234, and Tyr-319) in contact with Nevirapine have not been selected as sites of drug-resistance mutations, implying that there may be limitations on the number and types of resistance mutations that yield viable virus. Strategies of inhibitor design that target interactions with these conserved residues may yield drugs that are less vulnerable to escape mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {Much effort has been spent recently in identifying host factors required for HIV-1 to effectively replicate in cultured human cells. However, much less is known about the genetic factors in vivo that impact viral replication in lymphatic tissue, the primary anatomical site of virus-host interactions where the bulk of viral replication and pathogenesis occurs. To identify genetic determinants in lymphatic tissue that critically affect HIV-1 replication, we used microarrays to transcriptionally profile and identify host genes expressed in inguinal lymph nodes that were associated determinants of viral load. Strikingly, ∼95\% of the transcripts (558) in this data set (592 transcripts total) were negatively associated with HIV-1 replication. Genes in this subset 1) inhibit cellular activation/proliferation (e.g., TCFL5, SOCS5 and SCOS7, KLF10), 2) promote heterochromatin formation (e.g., HIC2, CREBZF, ZNF148/ZBP-89), 3) increase collagen synthesis (e.g., PLOD2, POSTN, CRTAP), and 4) reduce cellular transcription and translation. Potential anti-HIV-1 restriction factors were also identified (e.g., NR3C1, HNRNPU, PACT). Only ∼5\% of the transcripts (34) were positively associated with HIV-1 replication. Paradoxically, nearly all of these genes function in innate and adaptive immunity, particularly highlighting heightened gene expression in the IFN system. We conclude that this conventional host response cannot contain HIV-1 replication and, in fact, could well contribute to increased replication through immune activation. More importantly, genes that have a negative association with virus replication point to target cell availability and potentially new viral restriction factors as principal determinants of viral load.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV interclade B superinfection has previously been described in individuals initially infected with drug resistant virus who then become superinfected by a drug susceptible strain. We report an individual initially infected with a drug-sensitive clade B strain of HIV who was superinfected with another clade B strain resistant to two classes of antiretroviral drugs.To differentiate superinfection from possible co-infection we applied three independent molecular techniques: dye-primer sequencing of a pol fragment, length polymorphism analysis of the V4-5 coding region of the env gene and clonal sequencing of the V3 coding region of the env gene. To assess viral fitness we performed replication capacity assays of the pol gene.These investigations supported the conclusion that this was a case of superinfection and not co-infection. Coincident with acquiring the new strain, the individual's viral load increased by about 10,000 copies/ml with a decrease of 150 x CD4 T cells/mul over the next 6 months. The greater in vivo fitness of the second virus was not supported by the replication capacity assay. Furthermore, superinfection negatively impacted this individual's treatment course. It was not known that he had acquired a drug resistant strain before entering a treatment study, and he had an incomplete response to therapy most likely because the superinfecting viral strain had a decreased susceptibility to two of the prescribed medications.HIV drug resistance acquired through superinfection significantly lowers the likelihood of successful antiretroviral therapy and undermines the clinical value of a patient's prior drug resistance testing and lack of prior antiretroviral use.},

Commonly used protocols to measure population diversity using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are prone to the introduction of artificial chimeras. These are often difficult to detect and can confound the correct interpretation of results due to the false generation of recombinants when the underlying DNA sample contains multiple distinct templates. This study presents a standardised procedure to suppress the formation of artificial chimeras during PCR amplification. The solution is based on the accurate determination of the efficiency and end point of the log-linear phase of a PCR. This procedure will facilitate the generation of data sets that more accurately reflect the underlying population diversity rather than artifacts introduced by the process itself.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-cell heterogeneity in cell populations arises from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This heterogeneity has been measured for gene transcription, phosphorylation, cell morphology and drug perturbations, and used to explain various aspects of cellular physiology. In all cases, however, the causes of heterogeneity were not studied. Here we analyse, for the first time, the heterogeneous patterns of related cellular activities, namely virus infection, endocytosis and membrane lipid composition in adherent human cells. We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell, and we derive probabilistic models that can explain and predict most cellular heterogeneity of these activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population context. We find that accounting for population-determined heterogeneity is essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels of cell populations. Finally, we reveal that synergy between two molecular components, focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid GM1, enhances the population-determined pattern of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection. Our findings provide an explanation for the origin of heterogeneity patterns of cellular activities in adherent cell populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Isogenic cells in culture show strong variability, which arises from dynamic adaptations to the microenvironment of individual cells. Here we study the influence of the cell population context, which determines a single cell's microenvironment, in image-based RNAi screens. We developed a comprehensive computational approach that employs Bayesian and multivariate methods at the single-cell level. We applied these methods to 45 RNA interference screens of various sizes, including 7 druggable genome and 2 genome-wide screens, analysing 17 different mammalian virus infections and four related cell physiological processes. Analysing cell-based screens at this depth reveals widespread RNAi-induced changes in the population context of individual cells leading to indirect RNAi effects, as well as perturbations of cell-to-cell variability regulators. We find that accounting for indirect effects improves the consistency between siRNAs targeted against the same gene, and between replicate RNAi screens performed in different cell lines, in different labs, and with different siRNA libraries. In an era where large-scale RNAi screens are increasingly performed to reach a systems-level understanding of cellular processes, we show that this is often improved by analyses that account for and incorporate the single-cell microenvironment.},

  Abstract                 = {The major limitation of drug resistance genotyping for human immunodeficiency virus remains the interpretation of the results. We evaluated the concordance in predicting therapy response between four different interpretation algorithms (Rega 6.3, HIVDB-08/04, ANRS [07/04], and VGI 8.0). Sequences were gathered through a worldwide effort to establish a database of non-B subtype sequences, and demographic and clinical information about the patients was gathered. The most concordant results were found for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (93\%), followed by protease inhibitors (84\%) and nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTIs) (76\%). For therapy-naive patients, for nelfinavir, especially for subtypes C and G, the discordances were driven mainly by the protease (PRO) mutational pattern 82I/V + 63P + 36I/V for subtype C and 82I + 63P + 36I + 20I for subtype G. Subtype F displayed more discordances for ritonavir in untreated patients due to the combined presence of PRO 20R and 10I/V. In therapy-experienced patients, subtype G displayed a lot of discordances for saquinavir and indinavir due to mutational patterns involving PRO 90 M and 82I. Subtype F had more discordance for nelfinavir attributable to the presence of PRO 88S and 82A + 54V. For the NRTIs lamivudine and emtricitabine, CRF01_AE had more discordances than subtype B due to the presence of RT mutational patterns 65R + 115 M and 118I + 215Y, respectively. Overall, the different algorithms agreed well on the level of resistance scored, but some of the discordances could be attributed to specific (subtype-dependent) combinations of mutations. It is not yet known whether therapy response is subtype dependent, but the advice given to clinicians based on a genotypic interpretation algorithm differs according to the subtype.},

Here it is shown that, in human T-cell lines infected with HTLV-III, gene expression directed by the long terminal repeat sequence of this virus is stimulated by more than two orders of magnitude compared to matched uninfected cells. The rate of transcription of the HTLV-III long terminal repeat is more than 1000 times that of the SV40 early promoter in one infected cell line. Thus, HTLV-III, like HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the bovine leukemia virus, is characterized by trans-activation of transcription in infected cells. The efficiency of trans-activation in the case of HTLV-III may account, at least in part, for the virulent nature of HTLV-III infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence suggests that some human endogenous retroviruses and endogenous retrovirus-like repeats (here collectively ERVs) regulate the expression of neighboring genes in normal and disease states; e.g. the human globin locus is regulated by an ERV9 that coordinates long-range gene switching during hematopoiesis and activates also intergenic transcripts. While complex transcription regulation is associated with integration of certain exogenous retroviruses, comparable regulation sustained by ERVs is less understood.We analyzed ERV transcription using ERV9 consensus sequences and publically available RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) and cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) data from ENCODE. We discovered previously undescribed and advanced transcription regulation mechanisms in several human reference cell lines. We show that regulation by ERVs involves long-ranging activations including complex RNA splicing patterns, and transcription of large unannotated regions ranging in size from several hundred kb to around 1 Mb. Moreover, regulation was found to be cooperatively sustained in some loci by multiple ERVs and also non-LTR repeats.Our analyses show that endogenous retroviruses sustain advanced transcription regulation in human cell lines, which shows similarities to complex insertional mutagenesis effects exerted by exogenous retroviruses. By exposing previously undescribed regulation effects, this study should prove useful for understanding fundamental transcription mechanisms resulting from evolutionary acquisition of retroviral sequence in the human genome.},

To investigate the host range restriction of these viruses, we attempted to reconstruct functional envelopes by generating consensus genes and proteins. CERV1 and -2 enveloped MLV particles infected cell lines from a range of mammalian species. Using CERV2 Env-pseudotyped MLV reporters, we identified copper transport protein 1 (CTR1) as a receptor that was presumably used by CERV2 during its ancient exogenous replication in primates. Expression of human CTR1 was sufficient to confer CERV2 permissiveness on otherwise resistant hamster cells, and CTR1 knockdown or CuCl(2) treatment specifically inhibited CERV2 infection of human cells. Mutations in highly conserved CTR1 residues that have rendered hamster cells resistant to CERV2 include a unique deletion in a copper-binding motif. These CERV2 receptor-inactivating mutations in hamster CTR1 are accompanied by apparently compensating changes, including an increased number of extracellular copper-coordinating residues, and this may represent an evolutionary barrier to the acquisition of CERV2 resistance in primates.},

  Abstract                 = {Viral load (VL) monitoring is the standard of care in developing country settings for detecting HIV treatment failure. Since 2010 the World Health Organization has recommended a phase-in approach to VL monitoring in resource-limited settings. We conducted a systematic review of the accuracy and precision of HIV VL technologies for treatment monitoring.A search of Medline and Embase was conducted for studies evaluating the accuracy or reproducibility of commercially available HIV VL assays. 37 studies were included for review including evaluations of the Amplicor Monitor HIV-1 v1.5 (n = 25), Cobas TaqMan v2.0 (n = 11), Abbott RealTime HIV-1 (n = 23), Versant HIV-1 RNA bDNA 3.0 (n = 15), Versant HIV-1 RNA kPCR 1.0 (n = 2), ExaVir Load v3 (n = 2), and NucliSens EasyQ v2.0 (n = 1). All currently available HIV VL assays are of sufficient sensitivity to detect plasma virus levels at a lower detection limit of 1,000 copies/mL. Bias data comparing the Abbott RealTime HIV-1, TaqMan v2.0 to the Amplicor Monitor v1.5 showed a tendency of the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 to under-estimate results while the TaqMan v2.0 overestimated VL counts. Compared to the Amplicor Monitor v1.5, 2-26\% and 9-70\% of results from the Versant bDNA 3.0 and Abbott RealTime HIV-1 differed by greater than 0.5log10. The average intra and inter-assay variation of the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 were 2.95\% (range 2.0-5.1\%) and 5.44\% (range 1.17-30.00\%) across the range of VL counts (2log10-7log10).This review found that all currently available HIV VL assays are of sufficient sensitivity to detect plasma VL of 1,000 copies/mL as a threshold to initiate investigations of treatment adherence or possible treatment failure. Sources of variability between VL assays include differences in technology platform, plasma input volume, and ability to detect HIV-1 subtypes. Monitoring of individual patients should be performed on the same technology platform to ensure appropriate interpretation of changes in VL. Prospero registration # CD42013003603.},

  Abstract                 = {The majority of published gene-expression studies have used RNA isolated from whole cells, overlooking the potential impact of including nuclear transcriptome in the analyses. In this study, mRNA fractions from the cytoplasm and from whole cells (total RNA) were prepared from three human cell lines and sequenced using massive parallel sequencing.For all three cell lines, of about 15000 detected genes approximately 400 to 1400 genes were detected in different amounts in the cytoplasmic and total RNA fractions. Transcripts detected at higher levels in the total RNA fraction had longer coding sequences and higher number of miRNA target sites. Transcripts detected at higher levels in the cytoplasmic fraction were shorter or contained shorter untranslated regions. Nuclear retention of transcripts and mRNA degradation via miRNA pathway might contribute to this differential detection of genes. The consequence of the differential detection was further investigated by comparison to proteomics data. Interestingly, the expression profiles of cytoplasmic and total RNA correlated equally well with protein abundance levels indicating regulation at a higher level.We conclude that expression levels derived from the total RNA fraction be regarded as an appropriate estimate of the amount of mRNAs present in a given cell population, independent of the coding sequence length or UTRs.},

In agreement with previous in vitro studies, we find that the heat shock-mediated transcriptional induction of the hsp70 genes perturbs their chromatin structure, resulting in fewer protein-DNA contacts crosslinkable in vivo by formaldehyde. However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivo-crosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 DNA in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe protein-DNA interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {The transcription and splicing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA in primary blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and CD4(+) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were compared to determine whether any differences might account for the slower noncytopathic infection of cells of the macrophage lineage. The expression of regulatory mRNAs during acute infection of MDM was delayed by about 12 h compared to that of PBL. In each cell type, an increase in spliced viral mRNAs slightly preceded virus production from the culture. Following the peak of productive infection, there was a proportional decrease in the expression of all regulatory mRNAs detected in PBL. In MDM, a dramatic additional decrease specifically in the tat mRNA species heralded a reduction in virus production. This decline in tat mRNA was reflected by a concomitant decrease in Tat activity in the cells and occurred with the same kinetics irrespective of the age of the cells when infected. Addition of exogenous Tat protein elicited a burst of virus production from persistently infected MDM, suggesting that the decrease in virus production from the cultures is a consequence of the reduction in tat mRNA levels. Our results show that modulation of HIV-1 mRNAs in macrophages during long-term infection, which is dependent on the period of infection rather than cell differentiation or maturation, results in a selective reduction of Tat protein levels at the commencement of a persistent, less productive phase of infection. Determination of the mechanism of this mRNA modulation may lead to novel targets for control of replication in these important viral reservoirs.},

Virus isolates were examined for mutations conferring resistance to reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors and for genotype. The highly purified monocytes were also analysed for the presence of proviral and unintegrated viral DNA and multiply spliced (MS) viral mRNA by polymerase chain reaction.Virus was recovered from monocytes of five patients. Sequencing of the recovered viruses did not reveal multiple drug resistance, and was consistent with a non-syncytium-inducing/CCR5 phenotype. Proviral DNA was detectable in monocytes from all subjects, and unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and MS RNA was found in four out of five populations examined.Recovery of replication-competent virus from some HAART patients indicates that monocytes can also harbour HIV-1. Detection of circular, viral DNA and spliced RNA, albeit at very low levels, in these cells suggests that their infection is recent and transcriptionally active rather than latent.},

  Abstract                 = {A significant amount of literature was dedicated to hypotheses concerning the origin of ancient introns and exons, but accumulating evidence indicates that new exons are also constantly being added to evolving genomes. Several mechanisms contribute to the creation of novel exons in metazoan genomes, including whole gene and single exon duplications, but perhaps the most intriguing are events of exonization, where intronic sequences become exons de novo. Exonizations of intronic sequences, particularly those originating from repetitive elements, are now widely documented in many genomes including human, mouse, dog, and fish. Such de novo appearance of exons is very frequently associated with alternative splicing, with the new exon-containing variant typically being the rare one. This allows the new variant to be evolutionarily tested without compromising the original one, and provides an evolutionary strategy for generation of novel functions with minimum damage to the existing functional repertoire. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms leading to exonization, its extent in vertebrate genomes, and its evolutionary implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Central memory (TCM) CD4(+) T cells are the principal reservoir of latent HIV-1 infection that persists despite durable, successful antiretroviral therapy (ART). In a study that measured HIV DNA in 17 patients and replication-competent HIV in 4 patients, pools of resting and activated transitional memory (T(TM)) CD4(+) T cells were found to be a reservoir for HIV infection. As defective viruses account for the majority of integrated HIV DNA and do not reflect the actual frequency of latent, replication-competent proviral infection, we assessed the specific contribution of resting T(TM) cells to latent HIV infection. We measured the frequency of replication-competent HIV in purified resting memory cell subpopulations by a limiting-dilution, quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). HIV was routinely detected within the resting central memory compartment but was infrequently detected within the resting T(TM) compartment. These observations suggest that prolonged ART may limit persistent latent infection in the T(TM) compartment. Our results confirm the importance of latent infection within the TCM compartment and again focus attention on these cells as the most important latent viral reservoir. While proliferation may drive expansion of detectable viral genomes in cells, the frequency of replication-competent HIV must be carefully assessed. Latent infection appears to wane within the transitional memory compartment in patients who have sustained successful viral suppression via ART or were treated very early in infection.Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients. However, HIV integrates into the genome of CD4(+) T cells, generating pools of long-lived cells that are reservoirs of latent HIV. Two main subsets of CD4(+) T cells, central memory and transitional memory cells, were reported to be major reservoirs of HIV infection. However, this study primarily measured the HIV DNA content, which also includes defective proviruses that would not be able to replicate and initiate new rounds of infection. By analyzing the replication-competent virus in both cell subsets, we showed that transitional memory cells may not be a durable reservoir in patients on successful ART.},

  Abstract                 = {Cancer is viewed as a multistep process whereby a normal cell is transformed into a cancer cell through the acquisition of mutations. We reduce the complexities of cancer progression to a simple set of underlying rules that govern the transformation of normal cells to malignant cells. In doing so, we derive an ordinary differential equation model that explores how the balance of angiogenesis, cell death rates, genetic instability, and replication rates give rise to different kinetics in the development of cancer. The key predictions of the model are that cancer develops fastest through a particular ordering of mutations and that mutations in genes that maintain genomic integrity would be the most deleterious type of mutations to inherit. In addition, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the parameters included in the model to determine the probable contribution of each. This paper presents a novel approach to viewing the genetic basis of cancer from a systems biology perspective and provides the groundwork for other models that can be directly tied to clinical and molecular data.},

  Abstract                 = {Tumorigenesis in humans is thought to be a multistep process where certain mutations confer a selective advantage, allowing lineages derived from the mutated cell to outcompete other cells. Although molecular cell biology has substantially advanced cancer research, our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics that govern tumorigenesis is limited. This paper analyzes the computational implications of cancer progression presented by Hanahan and Weinberg in The Hallmarks of Cancer. We model the complexities of tumor progression as a small set of underlying rules that govern the transformation of normal cells to tumor cells. The rules are implemented in a stochastic multistep model. The model predicts that (i) early-onset cancers proceed through a different sequence of mutation acquisition than late-onset cancers; (ii) tumor heterogeneity varies with acquisition of genetic instability, mutation pathway, and selective pressures during tumorigenesis; (iii) there exists an optimal initial telomere length which lowers cancer incidence and raises time of cancer onset; and (iv) the ability to initiate angiogenesis is an important stage-setting mutation, which is often exploited by other cells. The model offers insight into how the sequence of acquired mutations affects the timing and cellular makeup of the resulting tumor and how the cellular-level population dynamics drive neoplastic evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {The possibility of HIV-1 eradication has been limited by the existence of latently infected cellular reservoirs. Studies to examine control of HIV latency and potential reactivation have been hindered by the small numbers of latently infected cells found in vivo. Major conceptual leaps have been facilitated by the use of latently infected T cell lines and primary cells. However, notable differences exist among cell model systems. Furthermore, screening efforts in specific cell models have identified drug candidates for "anti-latency" therapy, which often fail to reactivate HIV uniformly across different models. Therefore, the activity of a given drug candidate, demonstrated in a particular cellular model, cannot reliably predict its activity in other cell model systems or in infected patient cells, tested ex vivo. This situation represents a critical knowledge gap that adversely affects our ability to identify promising treatment compounds and hinders the advancement of drug testing into relevant animal models and clinical trials. To begin to understand the biological characteristics that are inherent to each HIV-1 latency model, we compared the response properties of five primary T cell models, four J-Lat cell models and those obtained with a viral outgrowth assay using patient-derived infected cells. A panel of thirteen stimuli that are known to reactivate HIV by defined mechanisms of action was selected and tested in parallel in all models. Our results indicate that no single in vitro cell model alone is able to capture accurately the ex vivo response characteristics of latently infected T cells from patients. Most cell models demonstrated that sensitivity to HIV reactivation was skewed toward or against specific drug classes. Protein kinase C agonists and PHA reactivated latent HIV uniformly across models, although drugs in most other classes did not.},

  Abstract                 = {Transcriptionally silent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA persists in resting memory CD4(+) T cells despite antiretroviral therapy. In a primary cell model, the antialcoholism drug disulfiram has been shown to induce HIV-1 transcription in latently infected resting memory CD4(+) T cells at concentrations achieved in vivo.We conducted a single-arm pilot study to evaluate whether 500 mg of disulfiram administered daily for 14 days to HIV-1-infected individuals on stable suppressive antiretroviral therapy would result in reversal of HIV-1 latency with a concomitant transient increase in residual viremia or depletion of the latent reservoir in resting memory CD4(+) T cells.Disulfiram was safe and well tolerated. There was a high level of subject-to-subject variability in plasma disulfiram levels. The latent reservoir did not change significantly (1.16-fold change; 95\% confidence interval [CI], .70- to 1.92-fold; P = .56). During disulfiram administration, residual viremia did not change significantly compared to baseline (1.53-fold; 95\% CI, .88- to 2.69-fold; P = .13), although residual viremia was estimated to increase by 1.88-fold compared to baseline during the postdosing period (95\% CI, 1.03- to 3.43-fold; P = .04). In a post hoc analysis, a rapid and transient increase in viremia was noted in a subset of individuals (n = 6) with immediate postdose sampling (HIV-1 RNA increase, 2.96-fold; 95\% CI, 1.29- to 6.81-fold; P = .01).Administration of disulfiram to patients on antiretroviral therapy does not reduce the size of the latent reservoir. A possible dose-related effect on residual viremia supports future studies assessing the impact of higher doses on HIV-1 production. Disulfiram affects relevant signaling pathways and can be safely administered, supporting future studies of this drug.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolution at high mutation rates is expected to reduce population fitness deterministically by the accumulation of deleterious mutations. A high enough rate should even cause extinction (lethal mutagenesis), a principle motivating the clinical use of mutagenic drugs to treat viral infections. The impact of a high mutation rate on long-term viral fitness was tested here. A large population of the DNA bacteriophage T7 was grown with a mutagen, producing a genomic rate of 4 nonlethal mutations per generation, two to three orders of magnitude above the baseline rate. Fitness-viral growth rate in the mutagenic environment-was predicted to decline substantially; after 200 generations, fitness had increased, rejecting the model. A high mutation load was nonetheless evident from (i) many low- to moderate-frequency mutations in the population (averaging 245 per genome) and (ii) an 80\% drop in average burst size. Twenty-eight mutations reached high frequency and were thus presumably adaptive, clustered mostly in DNA metabolism genes, chiefly DNA polymerase. Yet blocking DNA polymerase evolution failed to yield a fitness decrease after 100 generations. Although mutagenic drugs have caused viral extinction in vitro under some conditions, this study is the first to match theory and fitness evolution at a high mutation rate. Failure of the theory challenges the quantitative basis of lethal mutagenesis and highlights the potential for adaptive evolution at high mutation rates.},

The Rev-independent cell lines were created by using gag-pol and env expression vectors that contain the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) constitutive transport element (CTE). Vector titers approaching 10(4) CFU/ml were routinely obtained with these cell lines, as well as with the Rev-dependent cell lines, with HeLa-CD4 cells as targets. The presence of Nef and Tat in the producer cell each increased the vector titer 5- to 10-fold. Rev, on the other hand, was absolutely essential for gene transfer, unless the MPMV CTE was present in the vector. In that case, by using the Rev-independent cell lines for packaging, Rev could be completely eliminated from the system without a reduction in vector titer.},

Whether this is related to ART duration has not been explored.And Methods: Using SPARTAC trial data from individuals recruited within 6 months of seroconversion, we present an observational analysis investigating whether duration of ART was associated with post-treatment viraemic control. Kaplan-Meier estimates, logistic regression and Cox models were used.165 participants reached plasma viral loads (VL) <400 copies/ml at the time of stopping therapy (ART stop). After ART stop, 159 experienced confirmed VL ≥400 copies/ml during median (IQR) follow-up of 167 (108,199) weeks. Most participants experienced VL rebound within 12 weeks from ART stop, however, there was a suggestion of a higher probability of remaining <400 copies/ml for those on ART >12 weeks compared to ≤12 weeks (p=0.061). Cumulative probabilities of remaining <400 copies/ml at 12, 52 and 104 weeks after ART stop were 21\% (95\%CI=13,30), 4\% (1,9), and 4\% (1,9) for ≤12 weeks ART, and 32\% (22,42), 14\% (7,22), and 5\% (2,11) for >12 weeks. In multivariable regression, ART for >12 weeks was independently associated with a lower probability of being ≥400 copies/ml within 12 weeks of ART stop (OR=0.11 (95\%CI=0.03,0.34), p<0.001)). In Cox models of time to VL ≥400 after 12 weeks, we only found an association with female sex (OR=0.2, p=0.001).Longer ART duration in PHI was associated with a higher probability of viral control after ART stop.Controlled-Trials.com 76742797 http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN76742797.},

  Abstract                 = {Proportional expression of retroviral genes requires that splicing of the viral primary transcript be an inefficient process. Much of our current knowledge about retroviral suboptimal splicing comes from studies with Rous sarcoma virus. In this report, we describe the use of chimeric introns composed of human beta-globin and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) splice sites to establish the basis for inefficient splicing of the intron which comprises most of the HIV-1 env coding sequences (referred to as the tat/rev intron). S1 RNA analysis of transfected COS-7 cells revealed that the 3' splice site (3' ss) of this region was significantly less efficient than the 3' ss of the first intron of beta-globin. Deletion of sequences flanking the tat/rev intron 3' ss demonstrated that the requirements for its inefficiency reside within the region that is expected to comprise the essential signals for splicing (i.e., the branchpoint region, the polypyrimidine tract, and the AG dinucleotide). Introduction of an exact copy of the efficient beta-globin branchpoint sequence within a highly conserved region rendered the tat/rev intron 3' ss highly efficient. Improvement of the polypyrimidine tract also increased the splicing efficiency, but to a degree slightly less than that obtained with the branchpoint mutation. Subsequent examination of the tat/rev intron 5' splice site in a heterologous context revealed that it is efficiently utilized. These results indicate that both a poor branchpoint region and a poor polypyrimidine tract are responsible for the low splicing efficiency of the HIV-1 tat/rev intron. It is of fundamental interest to establish the basis for inefficient splicing of the HIV-1 tat/rev intron since it may provide the key to understanding why nuclear export of mRNAs encoding HIV-1 structural proteins is Rev dependent.},

The anti-HTLV-III prevalence was 6.6\% in sera from 1978 or 1979, and the subsequent annual incidence of seroconversion among susceptible men ranged between 5.5\% and 10.6\%. The highest incidences were in recent years, even though these men reported a decrease in their sexual activity during this time. These data demonstrate the continuing risk of HTLV-III infections in the homosexual population studied and emphasize the need for more effective prevention of transmission. The year during which antibody was first present was the only factor identified that was associated with altered cell-mediated immunity in antibody-positive men. Men who became antibody positive in 1981 or earlier currently had significantly lower OKT4/OKT8 ratios than did those who seroconverted more recently. Further follow-up will be necessary to establish the reasons for this association.},

  Abstract                 = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpr gene encodes a protein which induces arrest of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Here, we demonstrate that following the arrest of cells in G2, Vpr induces apoptosis in human fibroblasts, T cells, and primary peripheral blood lymphocytes. Analysis of various mutations in the vpr gene revealed that the extent of Vpr-induced G2 arrest correlated with the levels of apoptosis. However, the alleviation of Vpr-induced G2 arrest by treatment with the drug pentoxifylline did not abrogate apoptosis. Together these studies indicate that induction of G2 arrest, but not necessarily continued arrest in G2, was required for Vpr-induced apoptosis to occur. Finally, Vpr-induced G2 arrest has previously been correlated with inactivation of the Cdc2 kinase. Some models of apoptosis have demonstrated a requirement for active Cdc2 kinase for apoptosis to occur. Here we show that accumulation of the hypophosphorylated or active form of the Cdc2 kinase is not required for Vpr-induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that Vpr is capable of inducing apoptosis, and we propose that both the initial arrest of cells and subsequent apoptosis may contribute to CD4 cell depletion in HIV-1 disease.},

Like other lentiviruses, BIV has a complex genomic structure characterized by the presence of several regulatory/accessory genes that encode proteins, some of which are involved in the regulation of virus gene expression.

  Abstract                 = {Over 40 different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA species, both completely and incompletely spliced, are produced by alternative splicing of the primary viral RNA transcript. In addition, about half of the viral RNA remains unspliced and is transported to the cytoplasm where it is used both as mRNA and as genomic RNA. In general, the identities of the completely and incompletely spliced HIV-1 mRNA species are determined by the proximity of the open reading frames to the 5'-end of the mRNAs. The relative abundance of the mRNAs encoding the HIV-1 gene products is determined by the frequency of splicing at the different alternative 3'-splice sites. This chapter will highlight studies showing how HIV-1 uses exon definition to control the level of splicing at each of its 3'-splice sites through a combination of positively acting exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements, negatively acting exonic and intronic splicing silencer elements (ESS and ISS elements, respectively), and the 5'-splice sites of the regulated exons. Each of these splicing elements represent binding sites for cellular factors whose levels in the infected cell can determine the dominance of the positive or negative elements on HIV-1 alternative splicing. Both mutations of HIV-1 splicing elements and overexpression or inhibition of cellular splicing factors that bind to these elements have been used to show that disruption of regulated splicing inhibits HIV-1 replication. These studies have provided strong rationale for the investigation and development of antiviral drugs that specifically inhibit HIV-1 RNA splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {In HIV-1 infected cells, over 40 different mRNA species are produced by alternative splicing of the single HIV-1 primary RNA transcript. In addition, approximately half of the HIV-1 primary RNA transcripts are not spliced and are exported to the cytoplasm where they serve as mRNA and as genomic RNA. In this article, we will review current knowledge of the mechanisms by which the HIV-1 alternative splicing is regulated. Several negatively and positively-acting cis-acting elements have been detected within the viral genome that repress or facilitate viral RNA splicing by binding to cellular proteins. These include exonic splicing silencers (ESS) and an intronic splicing silencer (ISS) that are selectively bound either by members of the hnRNP A/B family (hnRNPs A1, A1(B), A2, and B1) or by hnRNP H. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) are also present within the HIV-1 genome and are selectively bound by members of the SR protein family. ESS and ISS repression mediated by hnRNP A/B proteins occurs at early steps of splicing, prior to formation of pre-spliceosome complexes. Current models propose that ESS elements promote cooperative binding of hnRNP A/B proteins to the exon and prevent efficient binding of essential cellular splicing factors to the 3' splice site. SR proteins bound to ESE elements that are juxtaposed or overlapping ESS elements may counteract this inhibition. We will review data indicating the importance of the HIV-1 splicing elements and their cognate binding proteins for efficient virus replication. Differences in cis-acting splicing elements between the group M (major) and group O (outlier) HIV-1 strains will also be discussed. Finally we will review evidence suggesting the possibility that there may be changes in regulation of HIV-1 alternative splicing in infected human T cells, human macrophages and rodent cells.},

The primary late assembly (L) domain in the p6 region of HIV-1 Gag mediates the detachment of the virion by recruiting host Tsg101, a component of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) machinery. We now show that HIV Gag p6 contains a second region involved in L domain function that binds AIP1, a homolog of the yeast class E Vps protein Bro1. Further, AIP1 interacts with Tsg101 and homologs of a subunit of the yeast class E Vps protein complex ESCRT-III. AIP1 also binds to the L domain in EIAV p9, and this binding correlates perfectly with L domain function. These observations identify AIP1 as a component of the viral budding machinery, which serves to link a distinct region in the L domain of HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 to ESCRT-III.},

To define all the elements required for the correct transcription activity of the ERV9 promoter and to establish a precise correlation between the elements important for basal transcription, we have systematically analyzed the in vivo and in vitro transcriptional activity of many different ERV9 promoter mutants, including a series of linker-scanning mutations across the promoter region. We report here that the ERV9 promoter contains two elements controlling the selection of the correct start sites, a TATA box and an Inr-like region; the concerted action of both elements is necessary for faithful transcription. Finally, using a series of GAL4 protein fusion constructs in cotransfection experiments, we demonstrated that various transcription factors can synergistically induce a high level of transcription when bound to an ERV9 DNA promoter.},

Our data suggest that vpu is posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation, since a 16-kilodalton phosphoprotein can be specifically immunoprecipitated with both a serum from an HIV-positive individual (HIV-positive serum) and a vpu-specific antiserum. In contrast, our results suggest that vpu is not glycosylated, even though the protein contains a potential glycosylation site. In vitro translation studies demonstrated that vpu is cotranslationally integrated into microsomal membranes, suggesting that vpu is an integral membrane protein. While vpu was found in significant quantities in virus-producing cells, the protein could not be detected in cell-free culture fluids and is therefore most likely not viron associated. Processing of viral precursor proteins was unaffected by the absence of vpu, and no differences were detected in the protein compositions of wild-type and mutant virions. However, virus release from cultures producing vpu-defective virus was found to be delayed, resulting in the intracellular accumulation of viral proteins. Our data suggest that vpu has a function in the release of virus particles from infected cells.},

Introduction of a frame-shift mutation into the vpu open reading frame did not significantly interfere with expression of the major viral proteins in a transient expression system. However, a five- to tenfold reduction in progeny virions was observed after the infection of T lymphocytes with the mutant virus. These data suggest that the vpu gene product is required for efficient virus replication and may have a role in assembly or maturation of progeny virions.},

  Abstract                 = {After acute HIV infection, CD8(+) T cells are able to control viral replication to a set point. This control is often lost after superinfection, although the mechanism behind this remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate in an HLA-B27(+) subject that loss of viral control after HIV superinfection coincides with rapid recombination events within two narrow regions of Gag and Env. Screening for CD8(+) T cell responses revealed that each of these recombination sites (approximately 50 aa) encompassed distinct regions containing two immunodominant CD8 epitopes (B27-KK10 in Gag and Cw1-CL9 in Env). Viral escape and the subsequent development of variant-specific de novo CD8(+) T cell responses against both epitopes were illustrative of the significant immune selection pressures exerted by both responses. Comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of CD8 responses and viral evolution indicated that the recombination events quickly facilitated viral escape from both dominant WT- and variant-specific responses. These data suggest that the ability of a superinfecting strain of HIV to overcome preexisting immune control may be related to its ability to rapidly recombine in critical regions under immune selection pressure. These data also support a role for cellular immune pressures in driving the selection of new recombinant forms of HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1-infected cells can avoid cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing by Nef-mediated down-regulation of surface MHC I. Here, we show that HIV-1 Nef inhibits MHC II restricted peptide presentation to specific T cells and thus may affect the induction of antiviral immune responses. Nef mediates this effect by reducing the surface level of mature (i.e., peptide-loaded) MHC II while increasing levels of immature MHC II, which are functionally incompetent because of their association with the invariant chain. Nef was the only HIV-1 gene product to possess this capacity, which was also observed in the context of the whole HIV-1 genome. Other proteins of the endocytic pathway were not affected by Nef expression, suggesting that Nef effects on MHC II did not result from a general alteration of the endocytic pathway. Response patterns to previously characterized mutations of Nef differed for Nef-induced modulation of mature and immature MHC II. Furthermore, the doses of Nef required to observe each of the two effects were clearly different, suggesting that Nef could affect MHC II peptide presentation through distinct mechanisms. Cooperation between those mechanisms may enable Nef to efficiently inhibit MHC II function.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing and gene duplication are two major sources of proteomic function diversity. Here, we study the evolutionary trend of alternative splicing after gene duplication by analyzing the alternative splicing differences between duplicate genes. We observed that duplicate genes have fewer alternative splice (AS) forms than single-copy genes, and that a negative correlation exists between the mean number of AS forms and the gene family size. Interestingly, we found that the loss of alternative splicing in duplicate genes may occur shortly after the gene duplication. These results support the subfunctionization model of alternative splicing in the early stage after gene duplication. Further analysis of the alternative splicing distribution in human duplicate pairs showed the asymmetric evolution of alternative splicing after gene duplications; i.e., the AS forms between duplicates may differ dramatically. We therefore conclude that alternative splicing and gene duplication may not evolve independently. In the early stage after gene duplication, young duplicates may take over a certain amount of protein function diversity that previously was carried out by the alternative splicing mechanism. In the late stage, the gain and loss of alternative splicing seem to be independent between duplicates.},

  Abstract                 = {It is currently well established that HIV-1 Vpr augments viral replication in primary human macrophages. In its virion-associated form, Vpr has been suggested to aid efficient translocation of the proviral DNA into the cell nucleus. Although Vpr growth-arrests dividing T cells, the relevance of this biological activity in nondividing macrophages is unclear. Here we use Vpr-mutants to demonstrate that the molecular determinants involved in G2-arresting T cells are also involved in increasing viral transcription in macrophages, even though these cells are refractive to the diploid DNA status typical of G2 phase. Our results suggest that the two phenotypes, namely the nuclear localization and the G2-arrest activity of the protein, segregate functionally among the late and early functions of Vpr. The nuclear localization property of Vpr correlates with its ability to effectively target the proviral DNA to the cell nucleus early in the infection, whereas the G2-arrest phenotype correlates with its ability to activate viral transcription after establishment of an infection. These two functions may render Vpr's role essential and not accessory under infection conditions that closely mimic the in vivo situation, that is, primary cells being infected at low viral inputs.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of retroviral DNA into a germ cell may lead to a provirus that is transmitted vertically to that host's offspring as an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). In humans, ERVs (HERVs) comprise about 8\% of the genome, the vast majority of which are truncated and/or highly mutated and no longer encode functional genes. The most recently active retroviruses that integrated into the human germ line are members of the Betaretrovirus-like HERV-K (HML-2) group, many of which contain intact open reading frames (ORFs) in some or all genes, sometimes encoding functional proteins that are expressed in various tissues. Interestingly, this expression is upregulated in many tumors ranging from breast and ovarian tissues to lymphomas and melanomas, as well as schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and other disorders.No study to date has characterized all HML-2 elements in the genome, an essential step towards determining a possible functional role of HML-2 expression in disease. We present here the most comprehensive and accurate catalog of all full-length and partial HML-2 proviruses, as well as solo LTR elements, within the published human genome to date. Furthermore, we provide evidence for preferential maintenance of proviruses and solo LTR elements on gene-rich chromosomes of the human genome and in proximity to gene regions.Our analysis has found and corrected several errors in the annotation of HML-2 elements in the human genome, including mislabeling of a newly identified group called HML-11. HML-elements have been implicated in a wide array of diseases, and characterization of these elements will play a fundamental role to understand the relationship between endogenous retrovirus expression and disease.},

Cyclin T1 is also required for Tat transactivation of HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression. Translation of Cyclin T1 mRNA has been shown to be repressed in human monocytes, and this repression is relieved when cells differentiate to macrophages. We identified miR-198 as a microRNA (miRNA) that is strongly down-regulated when monocytes are induced to differentiate. Ectopic expression of miR-198 in tissue culture cells reduced Cyclin T1 protein expression, and plasmid reporter assays verified miR-198 target sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Cyclin T1 mRNA. Cyclin T1 protein levels increased when an inhibitor of miR-198 was transfected into primary monocytes, and overexpression of miR-198 in primary monocytes repressed the normal up-regulation of Cyclin T1 during differentiation. Expression of an HIV-1 proviral plasmid and HIV-1 replication were repressed in a monocytic cell line upon overexpression of miR-198. Our data indicate that miR-198 functions to restrict HIV-1 replication in monocytes, and its mechanism of action appears to involve repression of Cyclin T1 expression.},

  Abstract                 = {SC35 belongs to the family of SR proteins that regulate alternative splicing in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. We previously reported that SC35 is expressed through alternatively spliced mRNAs with differing 3' untranslated sequences and stabilities. Here, we show that overexpression of SC35 in HeLa cells results in a significant decrease of endogenous SC35 mRNA levels along with changes in the relative abundance of SC35 alternatively spliced mRNAs. Remarkably, SC35 leads to both an exon inclusion and an intron excision in the 3' untranslated region of its mRNAs. In vitro splicing experiments performed with recombinant SR proteins demonstrate that SC35, but not ASF/SF2 or 9G8, specifically activates these alternative splicing events. Interestingly, the resulting mRNA is very unstable and we present evidence that mRNA surveillance is likely to be involved in this instability. SC35 therefore constitutes the first example of a splicing factor that controls its own expression through activation of splicing events leading to expression of unstable mRNA.},

By analysis of a panel of radiation hybrids, an ERV9 locus was mapped to within a 300-kbp region at the chromosome site 11q13. The marker cCLGW567 and the locus MAP3K11/D11S546 centromeric and telomeric flanked it, respectively. Northern blot analysis, using an ERV9 LTR probe, indicated that most normal tissues examined expressed low abundant ERV9 LTR driven mRNAs of various sizes. The most prominent expression was found in adrenal glands and testis. However, the level of expression varied in the same tissues among different individuals indicating that ERV9 mRNA expression probably is inducible in certain tissues or at various cell stages.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C); a synthetic analog of dsRNA) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, are known to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), but the mechanism(s) are incompletely understood. We found that poly(I:C)- and LPS-stimulation of MDMs abrogated infection by CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1, and by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, while TLR2, TLR7 or TLR9 agonists only partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection, or lack thereof, did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Integrated pro-viruses were readily detected in unstimulated, TLR7- and TLR9-stimulated cells, but not in TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated MDMs, suggesting the alteration of post-entry, pre-integration event(s). Using microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we found increased microRNA (miR)-155 levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4- but not TLR7-stimulation, and a miR-155 specific inhibitor (but not a scrambled control) partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated MDMs. Ectopic miR-155 expression remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection in primary MDMs and cell lines. Furthermore, poly(I:C)-stimulation and ectopic miR-155 expression did not alter detection of early viral RT products, but both resulted in an accumulation of late RT products and in undetectable or extremely low levels of integrated pro-viruses and 2-LTR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels of several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in trafficking and/or nuclear import of pre-integration complexes (ADAM10, TNPO3, Nup153, LEDGF/p75) were found in poly(I:C)-stimulated and miR-155-transfected MDMs, and a reporter assay suggested they are authentic miR-155 targets. Our findings provide evidence that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear RNA processing events, such as 5' cap formation, 3' polyadenylation, and pre-mRNA splicing, mark mRNA for efficient translation. Splicing enhances translation via the deposition of the exon-junction complex and other multifunctional splicing factors, including SR proteins. All retroviruses synthesize their structural and enzymatic proteins from unspliced genomic RNAs (gRNAs) and must therefore exploit unconventional strategies to ensure their effective expression. Here, we report that specific SR proteins, particularly SRp40 and SRp55, promote human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag translation from unspliced (intron-containing) viral RNA. This activity does not correlate with nucleocytoplasmic shuttling capacity and, in the case of SRp40, is dependent on the second RNA recognition motif and the arginine-serine (RS) domain. While SR proteins enhance Gag expression independent of RNA nuclear export pathway choice, altering the nucleotide sequence of the gag-pol coding region by codon optimization abolishes this effect. We therefore propose that SR proteins couple HIV-1 gRNA biogenesis to translational utilization.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite some degeneracy of sequence signals that govern splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, it is an accepted rule that U2-dependent introns exhibit the 3' terminal dinucleotide AG. Intrigued by anecdotal evidence for functional non-AG 3' splice sites, we carried out a human genome-wide screen.We identified TG dinucleotides functioning as alternative 3' splice sites in 36 human genes. The TG-derived splice variants were experimentally validated with a success rate of 92\%. Interestingly, ratios of alternative splice variants are tissue-specific for several introns. TG splice sites and their flanking intron sequences are substantially conserved between orthologous vertebrate genes, even between human and frog, indicating functional relevance. Remarkably, TG splice sites are exclusively found as alternative 3' splice sites, never as the sole 3' splice site for an intron, and we observed a distance constraint for TG-AG splice site tandems.Since TGs splice sites are exclusively found as alternative 3' splice sites, the U2 spliceosome apparently accomplishes perfect specificity for 3' AGs at an early splicing step, but may choose 3' TGs during later steps. Given the tiny fraction of TG 3' splice sites compared to the vast amount of non-viable TGs, cis-acting sequence signals must significantly contribute to splice site definition. Thus, we consider TG-AG 3' splice site tandems as promising subjects for studies on the mechanisms of 3' splice site selection.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: The functions of non-coding RNAs are strongly related to their secondary structures, but it is known that a secondary structure prediction of a single sequence is not reliable. Therefore, we have to collect similar RNA sequences with a common secondary structure for the analyses of a new non-coding RNA without knowing the exact secondary structure itself. Therefore, the sequence comparison in searching similar RNAs should consider not only their sequence similarities but also their potential secondary structures. Sankoff's algorithm predicts the common secondary structures of the sequences, but it is computationally too expensive to apply to large-scale analyses. Because we often want to compare a large number of cDNA sequences or to search similar RNAs in the whole genome sequences, much faster algorithms are required. RESULTS: We propose a new method of comparing RNA sequences based on the structural alignments of the fixed-length fragments of the stem candidates. The implemented software, SCARNA (Stem Candidate Aligner for RNAs), is fast enough to apply to the long sequences in the large-scale analyses. The accuracy of the alignments is better or comparable with the much slower existing algorithms. AVAILABILITY: The web server of SCARNA with graphical structural alignment viewer is available at http://www.scarna.org/.},

  Abstract                 = {Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I (the classical variety) is a dominantly inherited, genetically heterogeneous connective-tissue disorder. Mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes, which encode type V collagen, have been identified in several individuals. Most mutations affect either the triple-helical domain of the protein or the expression of one COL5A1 allele. We identified a novel splice-acceptor mutation (IVS4-2A-->G) in the N-propeptide-encoding region of COL5A1, in one patient with EDS type I. The outcome of this mutation was complex: In the major product, both exons 5 and 6 were skipped; other products included a small amount in which only exon 5 was skipped and an even smaller amount in which cryptic acceptor sites within exon 5 were used. All products were in frame. Pro-alpha1(V) chains with abnormal N-propeptides were secreted and were incorporated into extracellular matrix, and the mutation resulted in dramatic alterations in collagen fibril structure. The two-exon skip occurred in transcripts in which intron 5 was removed rapidly relative to introns 4 and 6, leaving a large (270 nt) composite exon that can be skipped in its entirety. The transcripts in which only exon 5 was skipped were derived from those in which intron 6 was removed prior to intron 5. The use of cryptic acceptor sites in exon 5 occurred in transcripts in which intron 4 was removed subsequent to introns 5 and 6. These findings suggest that the order of intron removal plays an important role in the outcome of splice-site mutations and provide a model that explains why multiple products derive from a mutation at a single splice site.},

Specific shRNAs can interfere with the replication of pathogenic viruses and are currently being tested as antiviral therapies in clinical trials. However, this effort is hindered by our inability to systematically and accurately identify potent shRNAs for viral genomes. Here we apply a recently developed highly parallel sensor assay to identify potent shRNAs for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and influenza. We observe known and previously unknown sequence features that dictate shRNAs efficiency. Validation using HIV and HCV cell culture models demonstrates very high potency of the top-scoring shRNAs. Comparing our data with the secondary structure of HIV shows that shRNA efficacy is strongly affected by the secondary structure at the target RNA site. Artificially introducing secondary structure to the target site markedly reduces shRNA silencing. In addition, we observe that HCV has distinct sequence features that bias HCV-targeting shRNAs toward lower efficacy. Our results facilitate further development of shRNA based antiviral therapies and improve our understanding and ability to predict efficient shRNAs.},

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of HERV-specific T cell responses in 42 vertically HIV-1-infected children. HERV (-H, -K, and -L family)-specific T cell responses were identified in 26 of 42 subjects, with the greatest magnitude observed for the responses to HERV-L. These HERV-specific T cell responses were inversely correlated with the HIV-1 plasma viral load and positively correlated with CD4(+) T cell counts. These data indicate that HERV-specific T cells may participate in controlling HIV-1 replication and that certain highly conserved HERV-derived proteins may serve as promising therapeutic vaccine targets in HIV-1-infected children.},

Here we show that hnRNP A1 inhibits splicing of this intron via a novel heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1-responsive intron splicing silencer (ISS) that can function independently of the previously characterized exon splicing silencer (ESS3). Surprisingly, depletion of hnRNP A1 from the nuclear extract (NE) enables splicing to proceed in NE that contains 100-fold reduced concentrations of U2AF and normal levels of SR proteins, conditions that do not support processing of other efficiently spliced pre-mRNAs. Reconstituting the extract with recombinant hnRNP A1 protein restores splicing inhibition at a step subsequent to U2AF binding, mainly at the time of U2 snRNP association. hnRNP A1 interacts specifically with the ISS sequence, which overlaps with one of three alternative branch point sequences, pointing to a model where the entry of U2 snRNP is physically blocked by hnRNP A1 binding.},

Here we show that the YL2 human homologue, the p32 protein, which co-purifies with alternative splicing factor ASF/SF2, interacts directly with the basic domain of Rev in vitro and that the Rev-p32 complex is resistant to high concentrations of salt or nonionic detergent. Protein footprinting data suggest that Rev interacts specifically with amino acids within the 196-208 region of p32. An analysis of the ternary complex, formed among p32, Rev, and RRE RNA, shows that Rev can bridge the association of p32 and RRE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exogenously added p32 specifically relieves the inhibition of splicing in vitro exerted by the basic domain of Rev. Our data are consistent with a model in which p32 functions as a link between Rev and the cellular splicing apparatus.},

  Abstract                 = {A family of mammalian protocadherin (Pcdh) proteins is encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (alpha, beta, and gamma). Multiple alpha and gamma Pcdh mRNAs are expressed in distinct patterns in the nervous system and are generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing between different "variable" exons and three "constant" exons within each cluster. We show that each Pcdh variable exon is preceded by a promoter and that promoter choice determines which variable exon is included in a Pcdh mRNA. In addition, we provide evidence that alternative splicing of variable exons within a gene cluster occurs via a cis-splicing mechanism. However, virtually every variable exon can engage in trans-splicing with constant exons from another cluster, albeit at a far lower level.},

Both methods generated similarly high-quality data: 84\% of the uniquely mapping reads fell within the targeted sequences; coverage was uniform across approximately 90\% of targeted bases; sequence variants were called with >99\% accuracy; and reproducibility between samples was high (r(2) = 0.9). We scaled the microdroplet PCR to 3,976 amplicons totaling 1.49 Mb of sequence, sequenced the resulting sample with both Illumina GAII and Roche 454, and obtained data with equally high specificity and sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that microdroplet technology is well suited for processing DNA for massively parallel enrichment of specific subsets of the human genome for targeted sequencing.},

Here we report that viral particles formed by p55gag, in contrast to particles formed by the Gag polyproteins of other retroviruses, contain significant amounts of cyclophilin A. Sequences in the capsid domain of p55gag are both required and sufficient for the virion-association of cyclophilin A. The association of cyclophilin A with HIV-1 virions was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cyclosporin A as well as by SDZ NIM811 ([Melle-4]cyclosporin), a non-immunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporin A. Drug-induced reductions in virion-associated cyclophilin A levels were accompanied by reductions in virion infectivity, indicating that the association is functionally relevant. Moreover, SDZ NIM811 inhibited the replication of HIV-1 but was inactive against SIVMAC, a primate immunodeficiency virus closely related to HIV-1, which does not incorporate cyclophilin A.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been previously observed that the intrinsically weak variant GC donor sites, in order to be recognized by the U2-type spliceosome, possess strong consensus sequences maximized for base pair formation with U1 and U5/U6 snRNAs. However, variability in signal strength is a fundamental mechanism for splice site selection in alternative splicing. Here we report human alternative GC-AG introns (for the first time from any species), and show that while constitutive GC-AG introns do possess strong signals at their donor sites, a large subset of alternative GC-AG introns possess weak consensus sequences at their donor sites. Surprisingly, this subset of alternative isoforms shows strong consensus at acceptor exon positions 1 and 2. The improved consensus at the acceptor exon can facilitate a strong interaction with U5 snRNA, which tethers the two exons for ligation during the second step of splicing. Further, these isoforms nearly always possess alternative acceptor sites and exhibit particularly weak polypyrimidine tracts characteristic of AG-dependent introns. The acceptor exon nucleotides are part of the consensus required for the U2AF(35)-mediated recognition of AG in such introns. Such improved consensus at acceptor exons is not found in either normal or alternative GT-AG introns having weak donor sites or weak polypyrimidine tracts. The changes probably reflect mechanisms that allow GC-AG alternative intron isoforms to cope with two conflicting requirements, namely an apparent need for differential splice strength to direct the choice of alternative sites and a need for improved donor signals to compensate for the central mismatch base pair (C-A) in the RNA duplex of U1 snRNA and the pre-mRNA. The other important findings include (i) one in every twenty alternative introns is a GC-AG intron, and (ii) three of every five observed GC-AG introns are alternative isoforms.},

  Abstract                 = {Human and mouse genomes share similar long-range sequence organization, and have most of their genes being homologous. As alternative splicing is a frequent and important aspect of gene regulation, it is of interest to assess the level of conservation of alternative splicing. We examined mouse transcript data sets (EST and mRNA) for the presence of transcripts that both make spliced-alignment with the draft mouse genome sequence and demonstrate conservation of human transcript-confirmed alternative and constitutive splice junctions. This revealed 15\% of alternative and 67\% of constitutive splice junctions as conserved; however, these numbers are patently dependent on the extent of transcript coverage. Transcript coverage of conserved splice patterns is found to correlate well between human and mouse. A model, which extrapolates from observed levels of conservation at increasing levels of transcript support, estimates overall conservation of 61\% of alternative and 74\% of constitutive splice junctions, albeit with broad confidence intervals. Observed numbers of conserved alternative splicing events agreed with those expected on the basis of the model. Thus, it is apparent that many, and probably most, alternative splicing events are conserved between human and mouse. This, combined with the preservation of alternative frame stop codons in conserved frame breaking events, indicates a high level of commonality in patterns of gene expression between these two species.},

  Abstract                 = {Maedi-visna is a slow virus infection of sheep leading to a progressing lymphoproliferative disease which is invariably fatal. It affects multiple organs, but primarily the lungs where it causes interstitial pneumonia (maedi). Infection of the central nervous system was commonly observed in Icelandic sheep (visna), infection of mammary glands (hard udder) in sheep in Europe and the USA, and infection of the joints in sheep in the USA. The name ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP) is commonly used in the USA and ovine lentivirus (OvLV) infection is also a name used for maedi-visna. A related infection of goats, caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE), is common in Europe and the USA. The natural transmission of maedi-visna is mostly by the respiratory route, but also to newborn lambs by colostrum and milk. Intrauterine transmission seems to be rare and venereal transmission is not well documented. Macrophages are the major target cells of maedi-visna virus (MVV), but viral replication is greatly restricted in the animal host, apparently due to a posttranscriptional block. The low-grade viral production in infected tissues can explain the slow course of the disease in sheep. The lesions in maedi-visna consist of infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, and are detectable shortly after experimental transmission. Several studies indicate that the lesions are immune mediated and that cytotoxic T-lymphocytes may be important effector cells. The persistence of the MVV infection is explained by a reservoir of latently infected blood and bone marrow monocytes, which migrate into the target organs and mature into macrophages with proviral DNA transcription, but limited replication of virus. The MVV particles are morphologically similar to those of other retroviruses and the mode of replication follows the same general pattern. The genome organization and gene regulation resembles that of other lentiviruses. In addition to gag, pol and env, MVV has three auxiliary genes (tat, rev and vif), which seem to have similar functions as in other lentiviruses, with a possible exception of the tat gene. A determination of the 9200 nucleotide sequence of the MVV genome shows a close relationship to CAE virus, but limited sequence homology with other lentiviruses, and only in certain conserved domains of the reverse transcriptase and possibly in the surface protein. MVV infection in sheep and HIV-1 infection in humans have a number of features in common such as a long preclinical period following transmission, and a slow development of multiorgan disease with fatal outcome. A brief early acute phase, which is terminated by the immune response, is also an interesting common feature. Like HIV-1, MVV is macrophage tropic and the early stages of the HIV-1 infection which affect the central nervous system and the lungs are in many ways comparable to maedi-visna. In contrast to HIV-1, MVV does not infect T-lymphocytes and does not cause T-cell depletion and immunodeficiency. This is responsible for the difference in the late stages of the HIV-1 and MVV infections and the final clinical outcome. Despite limited sequence homology, certain proteins of MVV and HIV-1 show structural and functional similarities. Studies of MVV may therefore help in the search for new drugs against lentiviruses, including HIV-1.},

  Abstract                 = {Chromatin structure influences transcription, but its role in subsequent RNA processing is unclear. Here we present analyses of high-throughput data that imply a relationship between nucleosome positioning and exon definition. First, we have found stable nucleosome occupancy within human and Caenorhabditis elegans exons that is stronger in exons with weak splice sites. Conversely, we have found that pseudoexons--intronic sequences that are not included in mRNAs but are flanked by strong splice sites--show nucleosome depletion. Second, the ratio between nucleosome occupancy within and upstream from the exons correlates with exon-inclusion levels. Third, nucleosomes are positioned central to exons rather than proximal to splice sites. These exonic nucleosomal patterns are also observed in non-expressed genes, suggesting that nucleosome marking of exons exists in the absence of transcription. Our analysis provides a framework that contributes to the understanding of splicing on the basis of chromatin architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {The human CD45 gene encodes a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that exhibits differential isoform expression in resting and activated T cells due to alternative splicing of three variable exons. Previously, we have used biochemical methods to identify two regulatory proteins, hnRNP L and PSF, which contribute to the activation-induced skipping of CD45 via the ESS1 regulatory element in variable exon 4. Here we report the identification of a third CD45 regulatory factor, hnRNP L-like (hnRNP LL), via a cell-based screen for clonal variants that exhibit an activation-like phenotype of CD45 splicing even under resting conditions. Microarray analysis of two splicing-altered clones revealed increased expression of hnRNP LL relative to wild-type cells. We further demonstrate that both the expression of hnRNP LL protein and its binding to ESS1 are up-regulated in wild-type cells upon activation. Forced overexpression of hnRNP LL in wild-type cells results in an increase in exon repression, while knock-down of hnRNP LL eliminates activation-induced exon skipping. Interestingly, analysis of the binding of hnRNP L and hnRNP LL to mutants of ESS1 reveals that these proteins have overlapping, but distinct binding requirements. Together, these data establish that hnRNP LL plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and demonstrate the utility of cell-based screens for the identification of novel splicing regulatory factors.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 proteins are synthesized from a single transcript in an unspliced form or following splicing, but the existence of an antisense protein (ASP) expressed from an antisense polyadenylated transcript has been suggested. Difficulties linked to the detection of this protein in mammalian cells led us to codon optimize its cDNA. Codon-optimized ASP was indeed efficiently detected in various transfected cell lines following flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses. Western blot analyses also led to the detection of optimized ASP in transfected cells but also provided evidence of its instability and high multimerization potential. ASP was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm in a punctate manner, which was reminiscent of autophagosomes. In agreement with this observation, a significant increase in ASP-positive cells and loss of its punctate distribution was observed in transfected cells when autophagy was inhibited at early steps. Induction of autophagy was confirmed by Western blot analyses that showed an ASP-mediated increase in levels of LC3b-II and Beclin 1, as well as colocalization and interaction between ASP and LC3. Interestingly, Myc-tagged ASP was detected in the context of proviral DNA following autophagy inhibition with a concomitant increase in the level and punctate distribution of LC3b-II. Finally, 3-methyladenine treatment of transfected or infected U937 cells decreased extracellular p24 levels in wild-type proviral DNA and to a much lesser extent in ASP-mutated proviral DNA. This study provides the first detection of ASP in mammalian cells by Western blotting. ASP-induced autophagy might explain the inherent difficulty in detecting this viral protein and might justify its presumed low abundance in infected cells.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) allows quantitative measurement of expression levels of genes and their transcripts. In this study, we sequenced complementary DNA fragments of cultured human B-cells and obtained 879 million 50-bp reads comprising 44 Gb of sequence. The results allowed us to study the gene expression profile of B-cells and to determine experimental parameters for sequencing-based expression studies. We identified 20,766 genes and 67,453 of their alternatively spliced transcripts. More than 90\% of the genes with multiple exons are alternatively spliced; for most genes, one isoform is predominantly expressed. We found that while chromosomes differ in gene density, the percentage of transcribed genes in each chromosome is less variable. In addition, genes involved in related biological processes are expressed at more similar levels than genes with different functions. Besides characterizing gene expression, we also used the data to investigate the effect of sequencing depth on gene expression measurements. While 100 million reads are sufficient to detect most expressed genes and transcripts, about 500 million reads are needed to measure accurately their expression levels. We provide examples in which deep sequencing is needed to determine the relative abundance of genes and their isoforms. With data from 20 individuals and about 40 million sequence reads per sample, we uncovered only 21 alternatively spliced, multi-exon genes that are not in databases; this result suggests that at this sequence coverage, we can detect most of the known genes. Results from this project are available on the UCSC Genome Browser to allow readers to study the expression and structure of genes in human B-cells.},

The method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea. For sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution, but the transfer was not quantitative. The method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures. The immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures. All additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein; then a specific antibody was bound and, finally, a second antibody directed against the first antibody. The second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase. The specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography, under UV light, or by the peroxidase reaction product, respectively. In the latter case, as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable. It is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands.},

Here we show that serine- and arginine-rich proteins 55 and 75 (SRp55 and SRp75) inhibit splicing from the 5'-splice site of exon 3 thereby causing an accumulation of the partially unspliced 13a7 vpr mRNA. In contrast, serine- and arginine-rich protein 40 (SRp40) induces splicing from exon 3 to exon 4, thereby promoting the production of the 1347 tat mRNA. We demonstrate that SRp55 stimulates vpr mRNA production by interacting with the previously identified HIV-1 splicing enhancer named GAR and inhibiting its function. This inhibition requires both serine arginine-rich and RNA-binding domains of SRp55, indicating that production of HIV-1 vpr mRNA depends on the interaction of SRp55 with an unknown factor.},

Here we show that SRp55 also inhibits splicing from HIV-1 exon 5 to generate HIV-1 vpu/env mRNA, albeit with lower efficiency. We also show that inhibition of HIV-1 splicing by SRp55 causes the appearance of partially spliced vpu, env and vpr mRNAs in the cytoplasm. SRp55 could also induce production of extracellular p24gag from a rev-defective HIV-1 provirus. These results indicate that SRp55 aids in the generation of partially spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs.},

We present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at transcript-level resolution and controls for variability evident across replicate libraries. Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript resolution, revealing a layer of regulation not readily observable with other high-throughput technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed >430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

It is assumed that the use of whole cell RNA in microarray gene expression analysis provides a legitimate profile of steady-state mRNA. Standard labeling methods and the prevailing dogma that mRNA resides almost exclusively in the cytoplasm has led to the long-standing belief that the nuclear RNA contribution is negligible. We report that unadulterated cytoplasmic RNA uncovers differentially expressed mRNAs that otherwise would not have been detected when using whole cell RNA and that the inclusion of nuclear RNA has a large impact on whole cell gene expression microarray results by distorting the mRNA profile to the extent that a substantial number of false positives are generated. We conclude that to produce a valid profile of the steady-state mRNA population, the nuclear component must be excluded, and to arrive at a more realistic view of a cell's gene expression profile, the nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions should be analyzed separately.},

This structure consists of a double-stranded portion, containing the insert of interest, and a single-stranded hairpin loop on either end, which provides a site for primer binding. Structurally, this format resembles a linear double-stranded molecule, and yet it is topologically circular. When placed into a single-molecule sequencing reaction, the SMRTbell template format enables a consensus sequence to be obtained from multiple passes on a single molecule. Furthermore, this consensus sequence is obtained from both the sense and antisense strands of the insert region. In this article, we present a universal method for constructing these templates, as well as an application of their use. We demonstrate the generation of high-quality consensus accuracy from single molecules, as well as the use of SMRTbell templates in the identification of rare sequence variants.},

We provide evidence for a physiological role of the miRNA-silencing machinery in controlling HIV-1 replication. Type III RNAses Dicer and Drosha, responsible for miRNA processing, inhibited virus replication both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1-infected donors and in latently infected cells. In turn, HIV-1 actively suppressed the expression of the polycistronic miRNA cluster miR-17/92. This suppression was found to be required for efficient viral replication and was dependent on the histone acetyltransferase Tat cofactor PCAF. Our results highlight the involvement of the miRNA-silencing pathway in HIV-1 replication and latency.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the interrelationship between diet, gut microbial ecology, and energy balance using a mouse model of obesity produced by consumption of a prototypic Western diet. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) produced a bloom in a single uncultured clade within the Mollicutes class of the Firmicutes, which was diminished by subsequent dietary manipulations that limit weight gain. Microbiota transplantation from mice with DIO to lean germ-free recipients promoted greater fat deposition than transplants from lean donors. Metagenomic and biochemical analysis of the gut microbiome together with sequencing and metabolic reconstructions of a related human gut-associated Mollicute (Eubacterium dolichum) revealed features that may provide a competitive advantage to members of the bloom in the Western diet nutrient milieu, including import and processing of simple sugars. Our study illustrates how combining comparative metagenomics with gnotobiotic mouse models and specific dietary manipulations can disclose the niches of previously uncharacterized members of the gut microbiota.},

  Abstract                 = {We previously examined competitive interactions among viruses by allowing the RNA phage phi6 to evolve at high and low multiplicities of infection (ratio of infecting viruses to bacterial cells). Derived high-multiplicity phages were competitively advantaged relative to their ancestors during coinfection, but their fixation caused population fitness to decline. These data conform to the evolution of lowered fitness in a population of defectors, as expected from the Prisoner's Dilemma of game theory. However, the generality of this result is unknown; the evolution of viruses at other multiplicities may alter the fitness payoffs associated with conflicting strategies of cooperation and defection. Here we examine the change in matrix variables by propagating the ancestor under strictly clonal conditions, allowing cooperation the chance to evolve. In competitions involving derived cooperators and their selfish counterparts, our data reveal a new outcome where the two strategies are predicted to coexist in a mixed polymorphism. Thus, we demonstrate that the payoff matrix is not a constant in phi6. Rather, clonal selection allows viruses the opportunity to escape the Prisoner's Dilemma. We discuss mechanisms that may afford selfish genotypes an advantage during intrahost competition and the relevance in our system for alternative ecological interactions among viruses.},

At high multiplicities, many phage infect and reproduce in the same host cell, whereas at low multiplicities the viruses reproduce mainly as clones. An unexpected result of this study was that phage grown at high rates of co-infection increased in fitness initially, but then evolved lowered fitness. Here we show that the fitness of the high-multiplicity phage relative to their ancestors generates a pay-off matrix conforming to the prisoner's dilemma strategy of game theory. In this strategy, defection (selfishness) evolves, despite the greater fitness pay-off that would result if all players were to cooperate. Viral cooperation and defection can be defined as, respectively, the manufacturing and sequestering of diffusible (shared) intracellular products. Because the low-multiplicity phage did not evolve lowered fitness, we attribute the evolution of selfishness to the lack of clonal structure and the mixing of unrelated genotypes at high multiplicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy to eradicate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), even in patients who suppress the virus to undetectable levels for many years, underscores the problems associated with fighting this infection. The existence of persistent infection in certain cellular and anatomical reservoirs appears to be the major hurdle in HIV eradication. The development of therapeutic interventions that eliminate or limit the latent viral pools or prevent the reemergence of the viruses from producing cells will therefore be required to enhance the effectiveness of current antiretroviral strategies. To achieve this goal, there is a pressing need to understand HIV latency at the molecular level to design novel and improved therapies to either eradicate HIV or find a functional cure in which patients could maintain a manageable viral pool without AIDS in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. The integrated proviral genome remains transcriptionally silent for a long period in certain subsets of T cells. This ability to infect cells latently helps HIV to establish a persistent infection despite strong humoral and cellular immune responses against the viral proteins. The main purpose of this report is to provide a general overview of the HIV latency. We will describe the hurdles being faced in eradicating latent HIV proviruses. We will also briefly discuss the ongoing strategies aimed toward curing HIV infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Nova proteins are a neuron-specific alternative splicing factors. We have combined bioinformatics, biochemistry and genetics to derive an RNA map describing the rules by which Nova proteins regulate alternative splicing. This map revealed that the position of Nova binding sites (YCAY clusters) in a pre-messenger RNA determines the outcome of splicing. The map correctly predicted Nova's effect to inhibit or enhance exon inclusion, which led us to examine the relationship between the map and Nova's mechanism of action. Nova binding to an exonic YCAY cluster changed the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) binding and exon inclusion, whereas Nova binding to an intronic YCAY cluster enhanced spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. Assays of splicing intermediates of Nova-regulated transcripts in mouse brain revealed that Nova preferentially regulates removal of introns harbouring (or closest to) YCAY clusters. These results define a genome-wide map relating the position of a cis-acting element to its regulation by an RNA binding protein, namely that Nova binding to YCAY clusters results in a local and asymmetric action to regulate spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing in neurons.},

We carried out genome-wide quantitative analysis of alternative splicing using a custom Affymetrix microarray to assess the role of the neuronal splicing factor Nova in the brain. We used a stringent algorithm to identify 591 exons that were differentially spliced in the brain relative to immune tissues, and 6.6\% of these showed major splicing defects in the neocortex of Nova2-/- mice. We tested 49 exons with the largest predicted Nova-dependent splicing changes and validated all 49 by RT-PCR. We analyzed the encoded proteins and found that all those with defined brain functions acted in the synapse (34 of 40, including neurotransmitter receptors, cation channels, adhesion and scaffold proteins) or in axon guidance (8 of 40). Moreover, of the 35 proteins with known interaction partners, 74\% (26) interact with each other. Validating a large set of Nova RNA targets has led us to identify a multi-tiered network in which Nova regulates the exon content of RNAs encoding proteins that interact in the synapse.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study is to verify whether HIV activates two endogenous retroviruses of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-W family, MSRV and Syncytin-1, whose neuropathogenic and immunopathogenic properties could contribute to HIV-related neurodegeneration.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocyte-macrophages and astrocytes were either infected by HIV or exposed to HIV-Tat, and/or other treatments. The expression of transcripts and proteins of interest was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting assays, respectively.HIV and Tat increase the levels of MSRVenv mRNAs and HERV-Wenv proteins in astrocytes and in blood cells. In monocyte-macrophages, Tat also induces high levels of CCR2, CD16 and Toll-like receptor4 (TLR4) molecules. Syncytin-1 response to Tat depends on the cell context: in monocytes, Tat stimulates MSRVenv and inhibits Syncytin-1, while in differentiated macrophages, it stimulates both elements. In primary astrocytes, Tat stimulates MSRV and Syncytin-1 indirectly, through interaction with TLR4 and induction of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), without internalization.In-vivo consequence of the study could be that, through increase of CD16 and CCR2, Tat promotes neuroinvasion not only by HIV-infected monocytes/macrophages but also by the HERV-Ws, with their neuropathogenic potential. Also, the novel finding of TLR4 stimulation by Tat may be of relevance, as TLR4 is critical in neuroinflammation. Within central nervous system (CNS), Tat-induced TNFα could induce high levels of the HERV-Ws, in both macrophages and astrocytes, also without HIV replication. The indirect mechanism by which Tat activates the HERV-Ws through induction of TNFα could add a new piece to the puzzle of CNS pathogenesis, that is the HERV-Wenv contribute to the HIV-related neurodegeneration.},

In experiments probing the entire mouse nuclear transcriptome, we accurately and simultaneously mapped single-stranded RNA regions in multiple ncRNAs with known structure. We probed in two cell types to verify reproducibility. We also identified and experimentally validated structured regions in ncRNAs with, to our knowledge, no previously reported probing data.},

We have created a new proteome identifier that uniquely identifies a particular assembly of a species and strain or subspecies to help users track the provenance of sequences. We present a new website that has been designed using a user-experience design process. We have introduced an annotation score for all entries in UniProt to represent the relative amount of knowledge known about each protein. These scores will be helpful in identifying which proteins are the best characterized and most informative for comparative analysis.

One strategy to achieve this goal is through active collaborations with scientists and developers, to make some of the field needs known and to help define the medical strategy behind the implementation of new diagnostic tests. Tests used in the field need to be effective in often extreme conditions and must also deliver high-quality, reliable results that can be used in the local context. In this article, we discuss some patient and health care provider needs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load measurement in resource-limited settings. This is just one of the areas in which effective, quality tools are desperately needed, not only by MSF and other international nongovernmental organizations, but also by many other health service providers. We hope that, by clearly defining the needs of patients in MSF clinics-as well as we can assess this-and by explaining why these tools are needed, how they should perform, and how their results can be integrated into a program, we will encourage the development of such tools and hasten their implementation in areas where they are so urgently needed.},

Profiles of expressed genes were assessed at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr postinfection and compared with those of matched uninfected PBMCs. Viral infection resulted in an overall increase in the number of genes expressed with peaks of expression at 1, 12, and 48 hr postinfection. Functional clustering of genes whose expression level in infected PBMCs varied by 2-fold or greater from levels in the controls indicated that cellular activation markers, proteins associated with immune cell function and with transcription and translation, exhibited increased expression subsequent to viral infection. Gene families exhibiting a decline in gene expression were confined to the 72 hr time point and included genes associated with catabolism and a subset of genes involved with cell signaling and synthetic pathways. Self-organizing map (SOM) cluster analysis identified temporal patterns of coordinated gene expression in infected PBMCs including genes associated with the immune response, the cytoskeleton, and ribosomal subunit structural proteins required for protein synthesis.},

Selection from a human complementary DNA (cDNA) library for clones able to induce resistance to infection by recombinant HIV-1 genomes resulted in the identification of a gene fragment that potently restricts HIV-1 activity. The active cDNA encodes an N-terminal fragment of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein U (hnRNP U). The gene fragment specifically targets the 3' long terminal repeat (3'LTR) in the viral mRNA and blocks the cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV-1 mRNAs. The results suggest that HIV-1 requires machinery for the nuclear export of viral mRNAs that can be specifically blocked by an interfering gene.},

Here we show that the interferon-induced cellular protein BST-2/HM1.24/CD317 is such a factor. BST-2 is downregulated from the cell surface by Vpu, and BST-2 is specifically expressed in cells that support the vpu phenotype. Exogenous expression of BST-2 inhibits HIV-1 virion release, while suppression of BST-2 relieves the requirement for Vpu. Downregulation of BST-2 requires both the transmembrane/ion channel domain and conserved serines in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu. Endogenous BST-2 colocalizes with the HIV-1 structural protein Gag in endosomes and at the plasma membrane, suggesting that BST-2 traps virions within and on infected cells. The unusual structure of BST-2, which includes a transmembrane domain and a lumenal GPI anchor, may allow it to retain nascent enveloped virions on cellular membranes, providing a mechanism of viral restriction counteracted by a specific viral accessory protein.},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in central Africa a prospective study was done in Kigali, Rwanda, where Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is endemic. During a 4 week period, 26 patients (17 males and 9 females) were diagnosed. 16 patients had opportunistic infections, associated with KS in only 2; 1 had multifocal KS alone; and 9 had clinical conditions consistent with prodromes of AIDS. All patients had severe T-cell defects characterised by cutaneous anergy, a striking decrease in the number of helper T cells, and a decreased OKT4:OKT8 ratio (mean 0.27). 21 of the 22 adult patients were living in urban centres and many of them were in the middle to upper income bracket. Most of the men were promiscuous heterosexuals and 43\% of the females were prostitutes. No patient had a history of homosexuality, intravenous drug abuse, or transfusion in the previous 5 years. This study suggests that AIDS is present in central Africa as an entity probably unrelated to the well-known endemic African KS. An association of an urban environment, a relatively high income, and heterosexual promiscuity could be a risk factor for AIDS in Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {The human genome contains multiple copies of retrovirus genomes known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that have entered the germ-line at some point in evolution. Several of these proviruses have retained (partial) coding capacity, so that a number of viral proteins or even virus particles are expressed under various conditions. Human ERVs (HERVs) belong to the beta-, gamma-, or spuma- retrovirus groups. Endogenous delta- and lenti- viruses are notably absent in humans, although endogenous lentivirus genomes have been found in lower primates. Exogenous retroviruses that currently form a health threat to humans intriguingly belong to those absent groups. The best studied of the two infectious human retroviruses is the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which has an overwhelming influence on its host by infecting cells of the immune system. One HIV-induced change is the induction of HERV transcription, often leading to induced HERV protein expression. This review will discuss the potential HIV-HERV interactions.Several studies have suggested that HERV proteins are unlikely to complement defective HIV virions, nor is HIV able to package HERV transcripts, probably due to low levels of sequence similarity. It is unclear whether the expression of HERVs has a negative, neutral, or positive influence on HIV-AIDS disease progression. A positive effect was recently reported by the specific expression of HERVs in chronically HIV-infected patients, which results in the presentation of HERV-derived peptides to CD8+ T-cells. These cytotoxic T-cells were not tolerant to HERV peptides, as would be expected for self-antigens, and consequently lysed the HIV-infected, HERV-presenting cells. This novel mechanism could control HIV replication and result in a low plasma viral load. The possibility of developing a vaccination strategy based on these HERV peptides will be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {It is now well established that the clade of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting west central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) comprises the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this study, we have greatly expanded our previous molecular epidemiological survey of SIVcpz in wild chimpanzees in Cameroon. The new results confirm a wide but uneven distribution of SIVcpzPtt in P. t. troglodytes throughout southern Cameroon and indicate the absence of SIVcpz infection in Pan troglodytes vellerosus. Analyzing 725 fecal samples from 15 field sites, we obtained partial nucleotide sequences from 16 new SIVcpzPtt strains and determined full-length sequences for two of these. Phylogenetic analyses of these new viruses confirmed the previously reported phylogeographic clustering of SIVcpzPtt lineages, with viruses related to the ancestors of HIV-1 groups M and N circulating exclusively in southeastern and south central P. t. troglodytes communities, respectively. Importantly, the SIVcpzPtt strains from the southeastern corner of Cameroon represent a relatively isolated clade indicating a defined geographic origin of the chimpanzee precursor of HIV-1 group M. Since contacts between humans and apes continue, the possibility of ongoing transmissions of SIV from chimpanzees (or gorillas) to humans has to be considered. In this context, our finding of distinct SIVcpzPtt envelope V3 sequence clades suggests that these peptides may be useful for the serological differentiation of SIVcpzPtt and HIV-1 infections, and thus the diagnosis of new cross-species transmissions if they occurred.},

  Abstract                 = {After integration in the host cell genome, the HIV-1 provirus is packaged into chromatin. A specific chromatin disruption occurs in the HIV-1 promoter during transcriptional activation in response to TNF-alpha, suggesting that chromatin plays a repressive role in HIV-1 transcription and that chromatin modification(s) might result in transcriptional activation. We have treated several cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 with two new specific inhibitors of histone deacetylase, trapoxin (TPX) and trichostatin A (TSA), to cause a global hyperacetylation of cellular histones. Treatment with both drugs results in the transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter and in a marked increase in virus production. Dose-response curves and kinetic analysis show a close correlation between the level of histone acetylation and HIV-1 gene expression. In contrast, both TPX and TSA have little or no effect on HIV-1 promoter activity following transient transfection of an HIV-1 promoter-reporter plasmid. Activation of HIV-1 transcription by TSA and TPX treatment occurs in the absence of NF-kappa B induction. Chromatin analysis of the HIV-1 genome shows that a single nucleosome (nuc-1) located at the transcription start and known to be disrupted following TNF-alpha treatment, is also disrupted following TPX or TSA treatment. This disruption is independent of transcription as it is resistant to alpha-amanitin. These observations further support the crucial role played by nuc-1 in the suppression of HIV-1 transcription during latency and demonstrate that transcriptional activation of HIV-1 can proceed through a chromatin modification.},

  Abstract                 = {In antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up programmes in sub-Saharan Africa viral load monitoring is not recommended. We wanted to study the impact of only using clinical and immunological monitoring on the diagnosis of virological ART failure under routine circumstances.Clinicians in two urban ART clinics in Malawi used clinical and immunological monitoring to identify adult patients for switching to second-line ART. If patients met clinical and/or immunological failure criteria of WHO guidelines and had a viral load <400 copies/ml there was misclassification of virological ART failure.Between January 2006 and July 2007, we identified 155 patients with WHO criteria for immunological and/or clinical failure. Virological ART failure had been misclassified in 66 (43\%) patients. Misclassification was significantly higher in patients meeting clinical failure criteria (57\%) than in those with immunological criteria (30\%). On multivariate analysis, misclassification was associated with being on ART <2 years [OR = 7.42 (2.63, 20.95)] and CD4 > 200 cells/microl [OR = 5.03 (2.05, 12.34)]. Active tuberculosis and Kaposi's sarcoma were the most common conditions causing misclassification of virological ART failure.Misclassification of virological ART failure occurs frequently using WHO clinical and immunological criteria of ART failure for poor settings. A viral load test confirming virological ART failure is therefore advised to avoid unnecessary switching to second-line regimens.},

Progression to death compared to the age and sex-matched general population was studied with a multivariate hazards model in 4174 (90.5\%) patients without AIDS events at 24 weeks. Life expectancy and number of life years lost were calculated using the predicted survival distribution.During 17 580 person-years of follow-up since 24 weeks after diagnosis [median follow-up 3.3 years, interquartile range (IQR) 1.6-5.8], 118 deaths occurred, yielding a mortality rate of 6.7 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.5-8.0] per 1000 person-years. Median CD4 cell counts at 24 weeks were 480 cells/microl (IQR 360-650). According to the model, the median number of years lived from age 25 was 52.7 (IQR 44.2-59.3; general population 53.1) for men and 57.8 (49.2-63.7; 58.1) for women without CDC-B event. The number of life years lost varied between 0.4 if diagnosed with HIV at age 25 and 1.4 if diagnosed at age 55; for patients with a CDC-B event this range was 1.8-8.0 years.The life expectancy of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who are still treatment-naive and have not experienced a CDC-B or C event at 24 weeks after diagnosis approaches that of non-infected individuals.

These countries appear to be the source of the HIV-1 group M epidemic, which then spread outwards to neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda in the east, and Congo-Brazzaville in the west. Further spread to Haiti and onwards to the USA can be explained by the hundreds of single men from Haiti who participated in the UNESCO educational programme in the Congo between 1960 and 1975.},

  Abstract                 = {Introns are removed from pre-mRNAs during transcription while the pre-mRNA is still tethered to the gene locus via RNA polymerase. However, during alternative splicing, it is important that splicing be deferred until all of the exons and introns involved in the choice have been synthesized. We have developed an in situ RNA imaging method with single-molecule sensitivity to define the intracellular sites of splicing. Using this approach, we found that the normally tight coupling between transcription and splicing is broken in situations where the intron's polypyrimidine tract is sequestered within strong secondary structures. We also found that in two cases of alternative splicing, in which certain exons are skipped due to the activity of the RNA-binding proteins Sxl and PTB, splicing is uncoupled from transcription. This uncoupling occurs only on the perturbed introns, whereas the preceding and succeeding introns are removed cotranscriptionally. PAPERCLIP:},

  Abstract                 = {Spatially synchronized fluctuations in system state are common in physical and biological systems ranging from individual atoms1 to species as diverse as viruses, insects and mammals2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Although the causal factors are well known for many synchronized phenomena, several processes concurrently have an impact on spatial synchrony of species, making their separate effects and interactions difficult to quantify. Here we develop a general stochastic model of predator–prey spatial dynamics to predict the outcome of a laboratory microcosm experiment testing for interactions among all known synchronizing factors: (1) dispersal of individuals between populations; (2) spatially synchronous fluctuations in exogenous environmental factors (the Moran effect); and (3) interactions with other species (for example, predators) that are themselves spatially synchronized. The Moran effect synchronized populations of the ciliate protist Tetrahymena pyriformis; however, dispersal only synchronized prey populations in the presence of the predator Euplotes patella. Both model and data indicate that synchrony depends on cyclic dynamics generated by the predator. Dispersal, but not the Moran effect, 'phase-locks' cycles, which otherwise become 'decoherent' and drift out of phase. In the absence of cycles, phase-locking is not possible and the synchronizing effect of dispersal is negligible. Interspecific interactions determine population synchrony, not by providing an additional source of synchronized fluctuations, but by altering population dynamics and thereby enhancing the action of dispersal. Our results are robust to wide variation in model parameters representative of many natural predator–prey or host–pathogen systems. This explains why cyclic systems provide many of the most dramatic examples of spatial synchrony in nature.},

To demonstrate this strategy, short diagnostic sequence tags were isolated from pancreas, concatenated, and cloned. Manual sequencing of 1000 tags revealed a gene expression pattern characteristic of pancreatic function. New pancreatic transcripts corresponding to novel tags were identified. SAGE should provide a broadly applicable means for the quantitative cataloging and comparison of expressed genes in a variety of normal, developmental, and disease states.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV/AIDS not only represents the most severe epidemic in modern times, but also the greatest public health challenge in history. The response of the scientific community has been impressive and in just a few years, turned an inevitably fatal disease into a chronic manageable although not yet curable condition. The development of antiretroviral therapy is not only the history of scientific advancements: it is the result of the passionate 'alliance' towards a common goal between researchers, doctors and nurses, pharmaceutical industries, regulators, public health officials and the community of HIV-infected patients, which is rather unique in the history of medicine. In addition, the rapid and progressive development of antiretroviral therapy has not only proven to be life-saving for many millions but has been instrumental in unveiling the inequities in access to health between rich and poor countries of the world. Optimal benefits indeed, are not accessible to all people living with HIV, with challenges to coverage and sustainability in low and middle income countries. This paper will review the progress made, starting from the initial despairing times, till the current battle towards universal access to treatment and care for all people living with HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a de novo assembly of a eukaryote transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing data. The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia; Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is a prominent species in population biology but had no previous genomic data. Sequencing runs using two normalized complementary DNA collections from a genetically diverse pool of larvae, pupae, and adults yielded 608,053 expressed sequence tags (mean length = 110 nucleotides), which assembled into 48,354 contigs (sets of overlapping DNA segments) and 59,943 singletons. BLAST comparisons confirmed the accuracy of the sequencing and assembly, and indicated the presence of c. 9000 unique genes, along with > 6000 additional microarray-confirmed unannotated contigs. Average depth of coverage was 6.5-fold for the longest 4800 contigs (348-2849 bp in length), sufficient for detecting large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Oligonucleotide microarray probes designed from the assembled sequences showed highly repeatable hybridization intensity and revealed biological differences among individuals. We conclude that 454 sequencing, when performed to provide sufficient coverage depth, allows de novo transcriptome assembly and a fast, cost-effective, and reliable method for development of functional genomic tools for nonmodel species. This development narrows the gap between approaches based on model organisms with rich genetic resources vs. species that are most tractable for ecological and evolutionary studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Chromatin organization of eukaryotic promoters is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the regulation of transcription in vivo. To determine the role of chromatin in HIV-1 expression, we have examined the nucleosome organization of the promoter of HIV-1 under low and high transcription rates. Independently of the cell line examined, nucleosomes are precisely positioned in the viral 5' long terminal repeat (5' LTR) and define two large nucleosome-free regions encompassing nt 200-450 and 610-720. A nucleosome positioned between these two regions, immediately after the transcription initiation site (nuc-1), is disrupted following TPA or TNF-alpha treatment. The disruption of nuc-1 from DNA is independent of DNA replication since it is completed in 20 min and independent of transcription as it is alpha-amanitin insensitive. A model is proposed in which nuc-1 plays an organizing role in the HIV-1 promoter to bring in close proximity factors bound to DNA in the two nucleosome-free regions, upstream and downstream of the site of transcription initiation. These results define chromatin as an integral component of the HIV-1 transcriptional regulatory machinery and identify a chromatin transition associated with activation of viral gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Radiolabeled amino acid sequencing was used to characterize gp41, an antigen of HTLV-III/LAV, the virus believed to be the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. This antigen is the one most commonly detected in immunoblot assays by sera of patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and other individuals infected with HTLV-III/LAV. A mouse monoclonal antibody that was reactive with gp41 precipitated a 160-kilodalton protein (gp160) in addition to gp41, but did not precipitate a 120-kilodalton protein (gp120) from extracts of metabolically labeled cells producing HTLV-III. Extracts of infected cells that had been labeled with tritiated leucine or isoleucine were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the p41 was eluted from the gel bands and subjected to amino-terminal radiolabeled amino acid sequencing by the semiautomated Edman degradation. Leucine residues occurred in cycles 7, 9, 12, 26, 33, and 34 among 40 cycles and isoleucine occurred in cycle 4 among 24 cycles analyzed. Comparison of the data with the deduced amino acid sequence of the env gene product of HTLV-III precisely placed gp41 in the COOH-terminal region of the env gene product. Gp160 is thus the primary env gene product and it is processed into gp120 and gp41.},

Non-permissive cells express the RNA editing enzyme, APOBEC3G. To determine whether vif mRNA could be alternatively spliced, a mutation altering the putative vif splice acceptor site (SA1) was introduced into SIV(mac239) (SIV(Deltavif-SA)). Despite three consensus splice acceptor sites nearby SA1, SIV(Deltavif-SA) did not efficiently generate alternatively spliced vif mRNA. SIV(Deltavif-SA) was growth attenuated in CEMx174 and H9 cells but not in CEM-SS cells. Following SIV(Deltavif-SA), but not SIV(mac239), infection in either H9 or CEMx174 cells viral cDNA contained numerous G to A mutations; no such differences were observed in CEM-SS cells. This pattern is consistent with mutations generated by APOBEC3G in the absence of Vif. Therefore, efficient splicing of SIV vif mRNA is tightly controlled and requires the SA1 site.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to document the genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; formerly Zaire). A total of 247 HIV-1-positive samples, collected during an epidemiologic survey conducted in 1997 in three regions (Kinshasa [the capital], Bwamanda [in the north], and Mbuyi-Maya [in the south]), were genetically characterized in the env V3-V5 region. All known subtypes were found to cocirculate, and for 6\% of the samples the subtype could not be identified. Subtype A is predominant, with prevalences decreasing from north to south (69\% in the north, 53\% in the capital city, and 46\% in the south). Subtype C, D, G, and H prevalences range from 7 to 9\%, whereas subtype F, J, K, and CRF01-AE strains represent 2 to 4\% of the samples; only one subtype B strain was identified. The highest prevalence (25\%) of subtype C was in the south, and CRF01-AE was seen mainly in the north. The high intersubtype variability among the V3-V5 sequences is the most probable reason for the low (45\%) efficiency of subtype A-specific PCR and HMA (heteroduplex mobility assay). Eighteen (29\%) of 62 samples had discordant subtype designations between env and gag. Sequence analysis of the entire envelope from 13 samples confirmed the high degree of diversity and complexity of HIV-1 strains in the DRC; 9 had a complex recombinant structure in gp160, involving fragments of known and unknown subtypes. Interestingly, the unknown fragments from the different strains did not cluster together. Overall, the high number of HIV-1 subtypes cocirculating, the high intrasubtype diversity, and the high numbers of possible recombinant viruses as well as different unclassified strains are all in agreement with an old and mature epidemic in the DRC, suggesting that this region is the epicenter of HIV-1 group M.},

  Abstract                 = {The human genome contains multiple LTR elements including human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) that together account for approximately 8-9\% of the genomic DNA. At least 40 different HERV groups have been assigned to three major HERV classes on the basis of their homologies to exogenous retroviruses. Although most HERVs are silenced by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, they may be reactivated by environmental stimuli such as exogenous viruses and thus may contribute to pathogenic conditions. The objective of this study was to perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of HIV-1 infection on HERV activity in different cell types.A retrovirus-specific microarray that covers major HERV groups from all three classes was used to analyze HERV transcription patterns in three persistently HIV-1 infected cell lines of different cellular origins and in their uninfected counterparts. All three persistently infected cell lines showed increased transcription of multiple class I and II HERV groups. Up-regulated transcription of five HERV taxa (HERV-E, HERV-T, HERV-K (HML-10) and two ERV9 subgroups) was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis and could be reversed by knock-down of HIV-1 expression with HIV-1-specific siRNAs. Cells infected de novo by HIV-1 showed stronger transcriptional up-regulation of the HERV-K (HML-2) group than persistently infected cells of the same origin. Analysis of transcripts from individual members of this group revealed up-regulation of predominantly two proviral loci (ERVK-7 and ERVK-15) on chromosomes 1q22 and 7q34 in persistently infected KE37.1 cells, as well as in de novo HIV-1 infected LC5 cells, while only one single HML-2 locus (ERV-K6) on chromosome 7p22.1 was activated in persistently infected LC5 cells.Our results demonstrate that HIV-1 can alter HERV transcription patterns of infected cells and indicate a correlation between activation of HERV elements and the level of HIV-1 production. Moreover, our results suggest that the effects of HIV-1 on HERV activity may be far more extensive and complex than anticipated from initial studies with clinical material.},

  Abstract                 = {Zidovudine (AZT) is a potent inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has been shown to improve survival in advanced HIV disease. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in adults with asymptomatic HIV infection who had CD4+ cell counts of fewer than 500 per cubic millimeter on entry into the study. The subjects (92 percent male) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo (428 subjects); zidovudine, 500 mg per day (453); or zidovudine, 1500 mg per day (457). After a mean follow-up of 55 weeks (range, 19 to 107), 33 of the subjects assigned to placebo had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as compared with 11 of those assigned to receive 500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.002; relative risk, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 5.6) and 14 of those assigned to receive 1500 mg of zidovudine (P = 0.05; relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.5). In the three treatment groups, the rates of progression (per 100 person-years) to either AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex were 7.6, 3.6, and 4.3, respectively. As compared with those assigned to placebo, the subjects in the zidovudine groups had significant increases in the number of CD4+ cells and significant declines in p24 antigen levels. In the 1500-mg zidovudine group, severe hematologic toxicity (anemia or neutropenia) was more frequent than in the other groups (P less than 0.0001). In the 500-mg zidovudine group, nausea was the only toxicity that was significantly more frequent (in 3.3 percent) than in the placebo group (P = 0.001). We conclude that zidovudine is safe and effective in persons with asymptomatic HIV infection and fewer than 500 CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter. Additional study will be required to determine whether such treatment will ultimately improve survival for persons infected with HIV.},

To test whether other proteins involved in MVB biogenesis (the class E proteins) also participate in HIV release, we identified 22 candidate human class E proteins. These proteins were connected into a coherent network by 43 different protein-protein interactions, with AIP1 playing a key role in linking complexes that act early (TSG101/ESCRT-I) and late (CHMP4/ESCRT-III) in the pathway. AIP1 also binds the HIV-1 p6(Gag) and EIAV p9(Gag) proteins, indicating that it can function directly in virus budding. Human class E proteins were found in HIV-1 particles, and dominant-negative mutants of late-acting human class E proteins arrested HIV-1 budding through plasmal and endosomal membranes. These studies define a protein network required for human MVB biogenesis and indicate that the entire network participates in the release of HIV and probably many other viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {Populations of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergo a surprisingly large amount of genetic drift in infected patients despite very large population sizes, which are predicted to be mostly deterministic. Several models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but all of them implicitly assume that the process of virus replication itself does not contribute to genetic drift. We developed an assay to measure the amount of genetic drift for HIV populations replicating in cell culture. The assay relies on creation of HIV populations of known size and measurements of variation in frequency of a neutral allele. Using this assay, we show that HIV undergoes approximately ten times more genetic drift than would be expected from its population size, which we defined as the number of infected cells in the culture. We showed that a large portion of the increase in genetic drift is due to non-synchronous infection of target cells. When infections are synchronized, genetic drift for the virus is only 3-fold higher than expected from its population size. Thus, the stochastic nature of biological processes involved in viral replication contributes to increased genetic drift in HIV populations. We propose that appreciation of these effects will allow better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on HIV in infected patients.},

A whole cell lysate, rather than phenol-purified DNA, was used for PCR amplification, under systematically optimized conditions designed and verified within each PCR run to detect as few as 10 copies of proviral DNA. A sequential testing algorithm was designed requiring reactivity in duplicate (with corresponding non-reactivity in negative controls) with at least two sets of primers, before reporting a specimen as HIV-1-positive. In 196 specimens from patients staged according to the Walter Reed staging system, the PCR test sensitivity and the coculture isolation rate (in parentheses) were found to be: 97\% (71\%), 100\% (85\%), and 100\% (76\%) in stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 specimens, respectively; and 100\% (100\%) in stage 4, 5, and 6 specimens. Results were uniformly negative for PCR and coculture isolation from 21 blind negative specimens and 105 (negative) donor leukopacks. These data indicate that this PCR testing algorithm is more accurate than tissue culture isolation methods, especially with early stage patients, and results in detection of HIV-1 in virtually 100\% of seropositive individuals, with no false positives.},

We used ultradeep sequencing (UDS) to estimate the frequency of DI in a primary infection cohort of predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM). HIV-1 genomes from longitudinal blood samples of recently infected, therapy-naive participants were interrogated with UDS. DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis. Coinfection was defined as DI at baseline; superinfection was monoinfection at baseline and DI at a later time point. Of 118 participants, 7 were coinfected and 10 acquired superinfection. Superinfection incidence rate was 4.96 per 100 person-years (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-9.22); 6 occurred in the first year and 4 in the second. Overall cumulative prevalence of intrasubtype B DI was 14.4\% (95\% CI, 8.6\%-22.1\%). Primary HIV-1 incidence was 4.37 per 100 person-years (95\% CI, 3.56-5.36). Intrasubtype DI was frequent and comparable to primary infection rates among MSM in San Diego; however, superinfection rates declined over time. DI is likely an important component of the HIV epidemic dynamics, and development of stronger immune responses to the initial infection may protect from superinfection.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how HIV-1 persists during effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) should inform strategies to cure HIV-1 infection. We hypothesize that proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells contributes to persistence of HIV-1 infection during suppressive ART. This predicts that identical or monotypic HIV-1 DNA sequences will increase over time during ART. We analyzed 1,656 env and pol sequences generated following single-genome amplification from the blood and sputum of six individuals during long-term suppressive ART. The median proportion of monotypic sequences increased from 25.0\% prior to ART to 43.2\% after a median of 9.8 years of suppressive ART. The proportion of monotypic sequences was estimated to increase 3.3\% per year (95\% confidence interval, 2.3 to 4.4\%; P < 0.001). Drug resistance mutations were not more common in the monotypic sequences, arguing against viral replication during times with lower antiretroviral concentrations. Bioinformatic analysis found equivalent genetic distances of monotypic and nonmonotypic sequences from the predicted founder virus sequence, suggesting that the relative increase in monotypic variants over time is not due to selective survival of cells with viruses from the time of acute infection or from just prior to ART initiation. Furthermore, while the total HIV-1 DNA load decreased during ART, the calculated concentration of monotypic sequences was stable in children, despite growth over nearly a decade of observation, consistent with proliferation of infected CD4(+) T cells and slower decay of monotypic sequences. Our findings suggest that proliferation of cells with proviruses is a likely mechanism of HIV-1 DNA persistence, which should be considered when designing strategies to eradicate HIV-1 infection.},

We evaluated the contribution of infected-cell proliferation and sites of proviral integration to HIV persistence. 534 HIV integration sites (IS) and 63 adjacent HIV env sequences were derived from three study participants over 11.3 to 12.7 years of ART. Each participant had identical viral sequences integrated at the same position in multiple cells, demonstrating infected-cell proliferation. Integrations were overrepresented in genes associated with cancer and favored in 12 genes across multiple participants. Over time on ART, a greater proportion of persisting proviruses were in proliferating cells. HIV integration into specific genes may promote proliferation of HIV-infected cells, slowing viral decay during ART.},

These guidelines were motivated, in part, by mounting evidence that the traditional approach of using risk factors to identify candidates for HIV testing is inadequate. Of the 1.0-1.2 million people in the United States thought to be infected with HIV, approximately 25\% remain unaware of their infection, and nearly half of all infected patients develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome < or = 1 year after testing positive for HIV. Also contributing to the change in testing guidelines was recent evidence that routine HIV testing is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness analysis, a method of assessing health care interventions in terms of the value they confer, reports results in terms of the resources that are required for the intervention to produce an additional unit of change in health effectiveness; more economically efficient programs are those with lower cost-effectiveness ratios. This article reviews the methods and results of cost-effectiveness studies in the United States and articulates why routine, voluntary HIV testing is not only of crucial public health importance but also economically justified.},

We estimated empirical error rates from four HIV-1 plasmid clones and used them to develop a statistical approach to distinguish authentic minor variants from sequencing errors in eight clinical samples. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing detected an average of 58 variants per sample compared with an average of eight variants per sample detected by conventional direct-PCR dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In the clinical sample with the largest number of minor sequence variants, all 60 variants present in ≥3% of genomes and 20 of 35 variants present in <3% of genomes were confirmed by limiting dilution sequencing. With appropriate analysis, ultra-deep pyrosequencing is a promising method for characterizing genetic diversity and detecting minor yet clinically relevant variants in biological samples with complex genetic populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Complete understanding of the route of HIV-1 transmission is an important prerequisite for curbing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. So far, the known routes of HIV-1 transmission include sexual contact, needle sharing, puncture, transfusion and mother-to-child transmission. Whether HIV can be vertically transmitted from human sperm to embryo by fertilization is largely undetermined. Direct research on embryo derived from infected human sperm and healthy human ova have been difficult because of ethical issues and problems in the collection of ova. However, the use of inter-specific in vitro fertilization (IVF) between human sperm and hamster ova can avoid both of these problems. Combined with molecular, cytogenetical and immunological techniques such as the preparation of human sperm chromosomes, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), this study mainly explored whether any integrated HIV provirus were present in the chromosomes of infected patients' sperm, and whether that provirus could be transferred into early embryos by fertilization and maintain its function of replication and expression. Evidence showed that HIV-1 nucleic acid was present in the spermatozoa of HIV/AIDS patients, that HIV-1 provirus is present on the patient sperm chromosome, that the integrated provirus could be transferred into early embryo chromosomally integrated by fertilization, and that it could replicate alongside the embryonic genome and subsequently express its protein in the embryo. These findings indicate the possibility of vertical transmission of HIV-1 from the sperm genome to the embryonic genome by fertilization. This study also offers a platform for the research into this new mode of transmission for other viruses, especially sexually transmitted viruses.},

  Abstract                 = {While nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an established mechanism to rapidly degrade select transcripts, the physiological regulation and biological significance of NMD are not well characterized. We previously demonstrated that NMD is inhibited in hypoxic cells. Here we show that the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) translation initiation factor by a variety of cellular stresses leads to the inhibition of NMD and that eIF2α phosphorylation and NMD inhibition occur in tumors. To explore the significance of this NMD regulation, we used an unbiased approach to identify approximately 750 NMD-targeted mRNAs and found that these mRNAs are overrepresented in stress response and tumor-promoting pathways. Consistent with these findings, the inhibition of NMD promotes cellular resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress and encourages tumor formation. The transcriptional and translational regulations of gene expression by the microenvironment are established mechanisms by which tumor cells adapt to stress. These data indicate that NMD inhibition by the tumor microenvironment is also an important mechanism to dynamically regulate genes critical for the response to cellular stress and tumorigenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in host defense, modulation of inflammatory processes, and surfactant-related functions of the lung. The human SP-A (hSP-A) locus consists of two functional genes, SP-A1 and SP-A2. Several hSP-A 5'-untranslated region (UTR) splice variants for each gene have been characterized and shown to be translated in vitro and in vivo. In this report, we investigated the role of hSP-A 5'-UTR splice variants on SP-A production and molecular mechanisms involved. We used in vitro transient expression of hSP-A 5'-UTR constructs containing luciferase as the reporter gene and quantitative real-time PCR to study hSP-A 5'-UTR-mediated gene expression. We found that 1) the four (A'D', ABD, AB'D', and A'CD') 5'-UTR splice variants under study enhanced gene expression, by increasing luciferase activity from 2.5- to 19.5-fold and luciferase mRNA from 4.3- to 8.8-fold compared with the control vector that lacked hSP-A 5'-UTR; 2) all four 5'-UTR splice variants studied regulated mRNA stability. The ABD variant exhibited the lowest rate of mRNA decay compared with the other three constructs (A'D', AB'D', and A'CD'). These three constructs also exhibited significantly lower rate of mRNA decay compared with the control vector; 3) based on the indexes of translational efficiency (luciferase activity/mRNA), ABD and AB'D' exhibited higher translational efficiency compared with the control vector, whereas the translational efficiency of each A'D' and A'CD' was lower than that of the control vector. These findings indicate that the hSP-A 5'-UTR splice variants play an important role in both SP-A translation and mRNA stability.},

  Abstract                 = {Integration of retroviral DNA into host cell DNA is a defining feature of retroviral replication. HIV integration is known to be favored in active transcription units, which promotes efficient transcription of the viral genes, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for targeting are not fully clarified. Here we used pyrosequencing to map 40,569 unique sites of HIV integration. Computational prediction of nucleosome positions in target DNA indicated that integration sites are periodically distributed on the nucleosome surface, consistent with favored integration into outward-facing DNA major grooves in chromatin. Analysis of integration site positions in the densely annotated ENCODE regions revealed a wealth of new associations between integration frequency and genomic features. Integration was particularly favored near transcription-associated histone modifications, including H3 acetylation, H4 acetylation, and H3 K4 methylation, but was disfavored in regions rich in transcription-inhibiting modifications, which include H3 K27 trimethylation and DNA CpG methylation. Statistical modeling indicated that effects of histone modification on HIV integration were partially independent of other genomic features influencing integration.

  Abstract                 = {Background The allele frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are needed to select an optimal subset of common SNPs for use in association studies. Sequence-based methods for finding SNPs with allele frequencies may need to handle thousands of sequences from the same genome location (sequences of deep coverage). Results We describe a computational method for finding common SNPs with allele frequencies in single-pass sequences of deep coverage. The method enhances a widely used program named PolyBayes in several aspects. We present results from our method and PolyBayes on eighteen data sets of human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with deep coverage. The results indicate that our method used almost all single-pass sequences in computation of the allele frequencies of SNPs. Conclusion The new method is able to handle single-pass sequences of deep coverage efficiently. Our work shows that it is possible to analyze sequences of deep coverage by using pairwise alignments of the sequences with the finished genome sequence, instead of multiple sequence alignments.},

  Abstract                 = {Naive embryonic stem cells hold great promise for research and therapeutics as they have broad and robust developmental potential. While such cells are readily derived from mouse blastocysts it has not been possible to isolate human equivalents easily, although human naive-like cells have been artificially generated (rather than extracted) by coercion of human primed embryonic stem cells by modifying culture conditions or through transgenic modification. Here we show that a sub-population within cultures of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) manifests key properties of naive state cells. These naive-like cells can be genetically tagged, and are associated with elevated transcription of HERVH, a primate-specific endogenous retrovirus. HERVH elements provide functional binding sites for a combination of naive pluripotency transcription factors, including LBP9, recently recognized as relevant to naivety in mice. LBP9-HERVH drives hESC-specific alternative and chimaeric transcripts, including pluripotency-modulating long non-coding RNAs. Disruption of LBP9, HERVH and HERVH-derived transcripts compromises self-renewal. These observations define HERVH expression as a hallmark of naive-like hESCs, and establish novel primate-specific transcriptional circuitry regulating pluripotency.},

  Abstract                 = {The Nef protein is an important virulence factor of primate lentiviruses, yet the mechanisms by which it exerts this influence are imperfectly understood. Here, using an inducible system, we demonstrate that Nef increases IL-2 secretion from T cells stimulated via CD3 or CD28. This effect requires the conservation of the Nef myristoylation signal and SH3-binding proline-based motif. Together with several proteins involved in the initiation and propagation of T cell signaling, Nef associates with membrane microdomains known as rafts. The Nef-mediated superinduction of IL-2 reflects the activation of both NFAT and NFkappaB. Accordingly, Nef also enhances HIV-1 transcription in response to CD3 or CD28 stimulation. Nef-induced IL-2 hyperresponsiveness is also observed in primary CD4 lymphocytes. Overall, these data suggest that Nef acts at the level of rafts to prime T cells for activation. Likely consequences of this effect are the promotion of HIV-1 replication and the facilitation of virus spread.},

Increased understanding of the mechanisms controlling pre-mRNA splicing is thus important for a wide range of aspects relating to gene expression.We have discovered a convex gene delineating pattern in the strength of 5(') intron splice sites. When comparing the strengths of >18 000 intron containing Human genes, we found that when analysing them separately according to the number of introns they contain, initial splice sites were always stronger on average than subsequent ones, and that a similar reversed trend exist towards the terminal gene part. The convex pattern is strongest for genes with up to 10 introns. Interestingly, when analysing the intron containing gene pool from mouse consisting of >15 000 genes, we found the convex pattern to be conserved despite >75 million years of evolutionary divergence between the two organisms. We also analysed an interesting, novel class of chimeric genes which during spliceosome assembly are fused and in tandem are transcribed and spliced into a single mature mRNA sequence. In their splice site patterns, these genes individually seem to deviate from the convex pattern, offering a possible rationale behind their fusion into a single transcript.brunak@cbs.dtu.dkSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {Commercial HIV-1 RNA viral load assays have been routinely used in developed countries to monitor antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, these assays require expensive equipment and reagents, well-trained operators, and established laboratory infrastructure. These requirements restrict their use in resource-limited settings where people are most afflicted with the HIV-1 epidemic. Inexpensive alternatives such as the Ultrasensitive p24 assay, the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay and in-house reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) have been developed. However, they are still time-consuming, technologically complex and inappropriate for decentralized laboratories as point-of-care (POC) tests. Recent advances in microfluidics and nanotechnology offer new strategies to develop low-cost, rapid, robust and simple HIV-1 viral load monitoring systems. We review state-of-the-art technologies used for HIV-1 viral load monitoring in both developed and developing settings. Emerging approaches based on microfluidics and nanotechnology, which have potential to be integrated into POC HIV-1 viral load assays, are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Short-read data from next-generation sequencing technologies are now being generated across a range of research projects. The fidelity of this data can be affected by several factors and it is important to have simple and reliable approaches for monitoring it at the level of individual experiments. RESULTS: We developed a fast, scalable and accurate approach to estimating error rates in short reads, which has the added advantage of not requiring a reference genome. We build on the fundamental observation that there is a linear relationship between the copy number for a given read and the number of erroneous reads that differ from the read of interest by one or two bases. The slope of this relationship can be transformed to give an estimate of the error rate, both by read and by position. We present simulation studies as well as analyses of real data sets illustrating the precision and accuracy of this method, and we show that it is more accurate than alternatives that count the difference between the sample of interest and the reference genome. We show how this methodology led to the detection of mutations in the genome of the PhiX strain used for calibration of Illumina data. The proposed method is implemented in an R package, which can be downloaded from http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~vwang/shadowRegression.html, and will be submitted to Bioconductor upon publication of this article. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method can be used to monitor the quality of sequencing pipelines at the level of individual experiments without the use of reference genomes. Furthermore, having an estimate of the error rates gives one the opportunity to improve analyses and inferences in many applications of next-generation sequencing data.},

  Abstract                 = {Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) function antagonistically to control histone acetylation. As acetylation is a histone mark for active transcription, HATs have been associated with active and HDACs with inactive genes. We describe here genome-wide mapping of HATs and HDACs binding on chromatin and find that both are found at active genes with acetylated histones. Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Furthermore, the majority of HDACs in the human genome function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes. Inactive genes that are primed by MLL-mediated histone H3K4 methylation are subject to a dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding, preventing Pol II from binding to these genes but poising them for future activation. Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs.},

However, because of the lack of global distribution data in higher eukaryotic systems, the extent to which gene-specific combinatorial patterns of histone modifications exist remains to be determined. Here, we report the patterns derived from the analysis of 39 histone modifications in human CD4(+) T cells. Our data indicate that a large number of patterns are associated with promoters and enhancers. In particular, we identify a common modification module consisting of 17 modifications detected at 3,286 promoters. These modifications tend to colocalize in the genome and correlate with each other at an individual nucleosome level. Genes associated with this module tend to have higher expression, and addition of more modifications to this module is associated with further increased expression. Our data suggest that these histone modifications may act cooperatively to prepare chromatin for transcriptional activation.},

Specimens were categorized and 57.3\% had low (weak) reactivity, 12.7\% had moderate reactivity, and 30.0\% had high reactivity. Highly reactive specimens were strongly associated with a positive Western blot or culture (86.7\%) in contrast to moderately and weakly reactive specimens (1.9\%). Twenty-five of 29 donors interviewed with a highly reactive EIA had risk factors for HTLV-III/LAV infection. Risk factors were not identified for 74 of 75 interviewed donors with specimens of lower reactivity. The minimum calculated specificity was 99.82\%.

We present evidence that Drosophila immune-competent cells have the potential to express more than 18,000 isoforms of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-superfamily receptor Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam). Secreted protein isoforms of Dscam were detected in the hemolymph, and hemocyte-specific loss of Dscam impaired the efficiency of phagocytic uptake of bacteria, possibly due to reduced bacterial binding. Importantly, the molecular diversity of Dscam transcripts generated through a mechanism of alternative splicing is highly conserved across major insect orders, suggesting an unsuspected molecular complexity of the innate immune system of insects.},

Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome and, potentially, many coding RNAs are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive RNA structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code.},

These sequences are organized in a highly chromosome-specific manner with many, if not all human chromosomes being characterized by individually distinct alphoid subsets. Here, we compare the nucleotide sequences of 153 monomer units, representing alphoid components of at least 12 different human chromosomes. Based on the analysis of sequence variation at each position within the 171 basepair monomer, we have derived a consensus sequence for the monomer unit of human alpha satellite DNA which we suggest may reflect the monomer sequence from which different chromosomal subsets have evolved. Sequence heterogeneity is evident at each position within the consensus monomer unit and there are no positions of strict nucleotide sequence conservation, although some regions are more variable than others. A substantial proportion of the overall sequence variation may be accounted for by nucleotide changes which are characteristic of monomer components of individual chromosomal subsets or groups of subsets which have a common evolutionary history.},

Two fourth-generation assays, HIV DUO (Biomérieux) and HIV Combi (Boehringer Mannheim), for the combined detection of HIV antigen and antibody, were compared with a third-generation assay (HIV-1/HIV-2 3rd Generation Plus enzyme immunoassay [EIA]; Abbott) and a p24 antigen test (HIV-1 Ag monoclonal; Abbott). A total of 17 seroconversion panels, 15 cell culture supernatants infected with different HIV type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes, and 255 potentially cross-reactive serum samples were tested. Ten seroconversions were detected an average of 8.1 days earlier with HIV DUO and 7.5 days earlier with HIV Combi than with the third-generation ELISA. Overall, in the 17 seroconversion panels tested, HIV DUO detected HIV-1 infection an average of 4.8 days and HIV Combi detected infection an average of 4.4 days earlier than HIV-1/HIV-2 3rd Generation Plus EIA. HIV antigen was detected with HIV DUO and HIV Combi in all of the 15 cell culture supernatants infected with different HIV-1 subtypes, including subtype O. With fourth-generation assays, considerably fewer false-positive results (n = 4 to 6) were obtained, in comparison with the third-generation EIA (n = 18). Fourth-generation assays permit an earlier diagnosis of HIV infection than third-generation antibody screening assays through the detection of p24 antigen, which may be present in serum samples from individuals with recent HIV infection prior to seroconversion.},

The new Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA with an improved sensitivity for HIV p24 antigen was compared to alternative fourth- and third-generation assays, the p24 antigen test, and HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 94 seroconversion panels (n = 709 sera), samples from the acute phase of infection after seroconversion (n = 32), anti-HIV-1-positive specimens (n = 730) from patients in different stages of the disease, 462 subtyped samples from different geographical locations, anti-HIV-2-positive sera (n = 302), dilutions of cell culture supernatants (n = 62) from cells infected with different HIV-1 subtypes, selected performance panels from Boston Biomedica Inc., 7,579 unselected samples from blood donors, 303 unselected daily routine samples, 997 specimens from hospitalized patients, and potentially interfering samples (n = 1,222) were tested with Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA. The new assay showed a sensitivity comparable to that of the Abbott HIV-1 AG Monoclonal A for early detection of HIV infection in seroconversion panels. The mean time delay of Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA (last negative sample plus 1 day) in comparison to that for HIV-1 RT-PCR for 87 panels tested with both methods was 2.75 days. The diagnostic window was reduced with Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA by between 3.6 and 5.7 days from that for third-generation assays. The specificities of Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA in blood donors were 99.84 and 99.85\% (after repeated testing). Overall, 30 repeatedly reactive false-positive results out of 10,031 HIV-negative samples were obtained with Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA. Our results show that a fourth-generation assay with improved specificity such as Cobas Core HIV Combi EIA is suitable for blood donor screening because of its low number of false positives and because it detects HIV p24 antigen with a sensitivity comparable to that of single-antigen assays.},

  Abstract                 = {An increasing proportion of deaths among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are due to complications of liver diseases.We investigated the frequency of and risk factors associated with liver-related deaths in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs study, which prospectively evaluated 76 893 person-years of follow-up in 23 441 HIV-infected persons. Multivariable Poisson regression analyses identified factors associated with liver-related, AIDS-related, and other causes of death.There were 1246 deaths (5.3\%; 1.6 per 100 person-years); 14.5\% were from liver-related causes. Of these, 16.9\% had active hepatitis B virus (HBV), 66.1\% had hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 7.1\% had dual viral hepatitis co-infections. Predictors of liver-related deaths were latest CD4 cell count (adjusted relative rate [RR], 16.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 8.1-31.7 for <50 vs > or =500/microL), age (RR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.4 per 5 years older), intravenous drug use (RR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2-3.4), HCV infection (RR, 6.7; 95\% CI, 4.0-11.2), and active HBV infection (RR, 3.7; 95\% CI, 2.4-5.9). Univariable analyses showed no relationship between cumulative years patients were receiving cART and liver-related death (RR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.93-1.07). Adjustment for the most recent CD4 cell count and patient characteristics resulted in an increased risk of liver-related mortality per year of mono or dual antiretroviral therapy before cART (RR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.16; P = .008) and per year of cART (RR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.21; P = .02).Liver-related death was the most frequent cause of non-AIDS-related death. We found a strong association between immunodeficiency and risk of liver-related death. Longer follow-up is required to investigate whether clinically significant treatment-associated liver-related mortality will develop.},

  Abstract                 = {Persistent latent reservoir of replication-competent proviruses in memory CD4 T cells is a major obstacle to curing HIV infection. Pharmacological activation of HIV expression in latently infected cells is being explored as one of the strategies to deplete the latent HIV reservoir. In this study, we characterized the ability of romidepsin (RMD), a histone deacetylase inhibitor approved for the treatment of T-cell lymphomas, to activate the expression of latent HIV. In an in vitro T-cell model of HIV latency, RMD was the most potent inducer of HIV (EC50 = 4.5 nM) compared with vorinostat (VOR; EC50 = 3,950 nM) and other histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in clinical development including panobinostat (PNB; EC50 = 10 nM). The HIV induction potencies of RMD, VOR, and PNB paralleled their inhibitory activities against multiple human HDAC isoenzymes. In both resting and memory CD4 T cells isolated from HIV-infected patients on suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), a 4-hour exposure to 40 nM RMD induced a mean 6-fold increase in intracellular HIV RNA levels, whereas a 24-hour treatment with 1 µM VOR resulted in 2- to 3-fold increases. RMD-induced intracellular HIV RNA expression persisted for 48 hours and correlated with sustained inhibition of cell-associated HDAC activity. By comparison, the induction of HIV RNA by VOR and PNB was transient and diminished after 24 hours. RMD also increased levels of extracellular HIV RNA and virions from both memory and resting CD4 T-cell cultures. The activation of HIV expression was observed at RMD concentrations below the drug plasma levels achieved by doses used in patients treated for T-cell lymphomas. In conclusion, RMD induces HIV expression ex vivo at concentrations that can be achieved clinically, indicating that the drug may reactivate latent HIV in patients on suppressive cART.},

We have isolated a novel 87 kDa cyclin C-related protein (cyclin T) that interacts specifically with the transactivation domain of Tat. Cyclin T is a partner for CDK9, an RNAPII transcription elongation factor. Remarkably, the interaction of Tat with cyclin T strongly enhances the affinity and specificity of the Tat:TAR RNA interaction, and confers a requirement for sequences in the loop of TAR that are not recognized by Tat alone. Moreover, overexpression of human cyclin T rescues Tat activity in nonpermissive rodent cells. We propose that Tat directs cyclin T-CDK9 to RNAPII through cooperative binding to TAR RNA.},

  Abstract                 = {Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many pathogens, yet their role in HIV-1 infection is unclear. To gain a better understanding of this role, we examined plasma from patients with acute HIV infection. Here we report the detection of autologous Nab as early as 52 days after detection of HIV-specific antibodies. The viral inhibitory activity of Nab resulted in complete replacement of neutralization-sensitive virus by successive populations of resistant virus. Escape virus contained mutations in the env gene that were unexpectedly sparse, did not map generally to known neutralization epitopes, and involved primarily changes in N-linked glycosylation. This pattern of escape, and the exceptional density of HIV-1 envelope glycosylation generally, led us to postulate an evolving 'glycan shield' mechanism of neutralization escape whereby selected changes in glycan packing prevent Nab binding but not receptor binding. Direct support for this model was obtained by mutational substitution showing that Nab-selected alterations in glycosylation conferred escape from both autologous antibody and epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The evolving glycan shield thus represents a new mechanism contributing to HIV-1 persistence in the face of an evolving antibody repertoire.},

We present an extensive experimental/computational study of an HIV-1 model vector (LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat) and show that stochastic fluctuations in Tat influence the viral latency decision. Low GFP/Tat expression was found to generate bifurcating phenotypes with clonal populations derived from single proviral integrations simultaneously exhibiting very high and near zero GFP expression. Although phenotypic bifurcation (PheB) was correlated with distinct genomic integration patterns, neither these patterns nor other extrinsic cellular factors (cell cycle/size, aneuploidy, chromatin silencing, etc.) explained PheB. Stochastic computational modeling successfully accounted for PheB and correctly predicted the dynamics of a Tat mutant that were subsequently confirmed by experiment. Thus, Tat stochastics appear sufficient to generate PheB (and potentially proviral latency), illustrating the importance of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression in a mammalian system.},

Here, using an HIV-1 model system, we directly quantify transcriptional feedback strength and its effects on both the duration of HIV-1 Tat transcriptional pulses and the fate of HIV-infected cells. By measuring shifts in the autocorrelation of noise inherent to gene expression, we found that transcriptional positive feedback extends the single-cell Tat expression lifetime two- to sixfold for both minimal Tat circuits and full length, actively replicating HIV-1. Notably, artificial weakening of Tat positive feedback shortened the duration of Tat expression transients and biased the probability in favor of latency. Thus, transcriptional positive feedback can modulate transient expression lifetime to a greater extent than protein half-life modulation, and it has a critical role in the cell-fate decision in HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {Kaposi's sarcoma has emerged from being a rarity to being the most important neoplasm in many sub-Saharan countries. Most investigators involved in Kaposi's sarcoma research now agree that the gammaherpesvirus human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also called Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is central in the pathogenesis of this disease (1,2). Molecular and seroepidemiologic studies (3,4) have confirmed the association between HHV8 and Kaposi's sarcoma. However, the role of HHV8 in the initiation and maintenance of proliferation of Kaposi's sarcoma tumor cells (spindle cells) remains unclear. Before the discovery of HHV8 (5), it was thought that cellular cytokines, growth factors, and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein initiate and promote the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma spindle cells (6). The fact that the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma is much higher among HIV-1-infected individuals than among iatrogenic immunosuppressed patients probably reflects the prevalence of HHV8 in different populations, rather than indicates that HIV-1 itself plays a role. Kaposi's sarcoma, like HHV8, is rare in HIV-positive, injecting drug users and in patients with hemophilia (3). However, rapidly progressive Kaposi's sarcoma affecting extensive parts of the skin, oral and genital mucosae, and internal organs is seldom seen in HIV-negative patients, even in those iatrogenically immunosuppressed for prolonged periods. This observation favors a synergistic role for HHV8 and for HIV-1 in promoting growth of Kaposi's sarcoma spindle cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an mRNA surveillance mechanism which rapidly degrades select cytoplasmic mRNAs. We and others have shown that NMD is a dynamically regulated process inhibited by amino acid deprivation, hypoxia, and other cellular stresses commonly generated by the tumor microenvironment. This inhibition of NMD can result in the accumulation of misfolded, mutated, and aggregated proteins, but how cells adapt to these aberrant proteins is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of NMD activates autophagy, an established protein surveillance mechanism, both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, the hyperactivation of NMD blunts the induction of autophagy in response to a variety of cellular stresses. The regulation of autophagy by NMD is due, in part, to stabilization of the documented NMD target ATF4. NMD inhibition increases intracellular amino acids, a hallmark of autophagy, and the concomitant inhibition of autophagy and NMD, either molecularly or pharmacologically, leads to synergistic cell death. Together these studies indicate that autophagy is an adaptive response to NMD inhibition and uncover a novel relationship between an mRNA surveillance system and a protein surveillance system, with important implications for the treatment of cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {We have isolated a naturally arising human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) mutant containing a point mutation within the env gene. The point mutation resulted in complete loss of balanced splicing, with dominant production of aberrant mRNAs. The aberrant RNAs arose via activation of normally cryptic splice sites flanking the mutation within the env terminal exon to create exon 6D, which was subsequently incorporated in aberrant env, tat, rev, and nef mRNAs. Aberrant multiply spliced messages contributed to reduced virus replication as a result of a reduction in wild-type Rev protein. The point mutation within exon 6D activated exon 6D inclusion when the exon and its flanking splice sites were transferred to a heterologous minigene. Introduction of the point mutation into an otherwise wild-type HIV-1 proviral clone resulted in virus that was severely inhibited for replication in T cells and displayed elevated usage of exon 6D. Exon 6D contains a bipartite element similar to that seen in tat exon 3 of HIV-1, consisting of a potential exon splicing silencer (ESS) juxtaposed to a purine-rich sequence similar to known exon splicing enhancers. In the absence of a flanking 5' splice site, the point mutation within the exon 6D ESS-like element strongly activated env splicing, suggesting that the putative ESS plays a natural role in limiting the level of env splicing. We propose, therefore, that exon silencers may be a common element in the HIV-1 genome used to create balanced splicing of multiple products from a single precursor RNA.},

A better understanding of the properties and dynamics of this network is essential for surveillance, prevention, and eventual eradication of HIV. Here, we apply a simple and computationally efficient network-based approach to all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the global database, revealing a contemporary picture of the spread of HIV-1 within and between countries. This approach automatically recovered well-characterized transmission clusters and extended other clusters thought to be contained within a single country across international borders. In addition, previously undescribed transmission clusters were discovered. Together, these clusters represent all known modes of HIV transmission. The extent of international linkage revealed by our comprehensive approach demonstrates the need to consider the global diversity of HIV, even when describing local epidemics. Finally, the speed of this method allows for near-real-time surveillance of the pandemic's progression.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a powerful tool to suppress gene expression and can be used as a therapeutic strategy against human pathogenic viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Theoretically, RNAi-mediated inhibition can occur at two points in the replication cycle, upon viral entry before reverse transcription of the RNA genome, and on the newly transcribed viral RNA transcripts. There have been conflicting results on whether RNAi can target the RNA genome of infecting HIV-1 particles. We have addressed this issue with HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors.We determined the transduction efficiency of a lentiviral vector, as measured by GFP expressing cells, which reflects the number of successful integration events in a cell line stably expressing shNef. We did not observe a difference in the transduction efficiency comparing lentiviral vectors with or without the Nef target sequence in their genome. The results were similar with particles pseudotyped with either the VSV-G or HIV-1 envelope. Additionally, no reduced transduction efficiencies were observed with multiple other shRNAs targeting the vector genome or with synthetic siNef when transiently transfected prior to transduction.Our findings indicate that the incoming HIV-1 RNA genome is not targeted by RNAi, probably due to inaccessibility to the RNAi machinery. Thus, therapeutic RNAi strategies aimed at preventing proviral integration should be targeting cellular receptors or co-factors involved in pre-integration events.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 replication can be efficiently inhibited by intracellular expression of an siRNA targeting the viral RNA. However, HIV-1 escape variants emerged after prolonged culturing. These RNAi-resistant viruses contain nucleotide substitutions or deletions in or near the targeted sequence. We observed an inverse correlation between the level of resistance and the stability of the siRNA/target-RNA duplex. However, two escape variants showed a higher level of resistance than expected based on the duplex stability. We demonstrate that these mutations induce alternative folding of the RNA such that the target sequence is occluded from binding to the siRNA, resulting in reduced RNAi efficiency. HIV-1 can thus escape from RNAi-mediated inhibition not only through nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the siRNA target sequence, but also through mutations that alter the local RNA secondary structure. The results highlight the enormous genetic flexibility of HIV-1 and provide detailed molecular insight into the sequence specificity of RNAi and the impact of target RNA secondary structure.},

  Abstract                 = {The association of genetic variation with disease and drug response, and improvements in nucleic acid technologies, have given great optimism for the impact of 'genomic medicine'. However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome1, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2–40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual2 by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next-generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of 'personalized genome sequencing'.},

  Abstract                 = {The question of how HIV-1 interfaces with cellular microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and effector mechanisms has been highly controversial. Here, we first used deep sequencing of small RNAs present in two different infected cell lines (TZM-bl and C8166) and two types of primary human cells (CD4(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] and macrophages) to unequivocally demonstrate that HIV-1 does not encode any viral miRNAs. Perhaps surprisingly, we also observed that infection of T cells by HIV-1 has only a modest effect on the expression of cellular miRNAs at early times after infection. Comprehensive analysis of miRNA binding to the HIV-1 genome using the photoactivatable ribonucleoside-induced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) technique revealed several binding sites for cellular miRNAs, a subset of which were shown to be capable of mediating miRNA-mediated repression of gene expression. However, the main finding from this analysis is that HIV-1 transcripts are largely refractory to miRNA binding, most probably due to extensive viral RNA secondary structure. Together, these data demonstrate that HIV-1 neither encodes viral miRNAs nor strongly influences cellular miRNA expression, at least early after infection, and imply that HIV-1 transcripts have evolved to avoid inhibition by preexisting cellular miRNAs by adopting extensive RNA secondary structures that occlude most potential miRNA binding sites.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a ubiquitous class of small regulatory RNAs that serve as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Previous work has suggested that HIV-1 might subvert the function of the cellular miRNA machinery by expressing viral miRNAs or by dramatically altering the level of cellular miRNA expression. Using very sensitive approaches, we now demonstrate that neither of these ideas is in fact correct. Moreover, HIV-1 transcripts appear to largely avoid regulation by cellular miRNAs by adopting an extensive RNA secondary structure that occludes the ability of cellular miRNAs to interact with viral mRNAs. Together, these data suggest that HIV-1, rather than seeking to control miRNA function in infected cells, has instead evolved a mechanism to become largely invisible to cellular miRNA effector mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation DNA sequencing on the 454, Solexa, and SOLiD platforms requires absolute calibration of the number of molecules to be sequenced. This requirement has two unfavorable consequences. First, large amounts of sample-typically micrograms-are needed for library preparation, thereby limiting the scope of samples which can be sequenced. For many applications, including metagenomics and the sequencing of ancient, forensic, and clinical samples, the quantity of input DNA can be critically limiting. Second, each library requires a titration sequencing run, thereby increasing the cost and lowering the throughput of sequencing. RESULTS: We demonstrate the use of digital PCR to accurately quantify 454 and Solexa sequencing libraries, enabling the preparation of sequencing libraries from nanogram quantities of input material while eliminating costly and time-consuming titration runs of the sequencer. We successfully sequenced low-nanogram scale bacterial and mammalian DNA samples on the 454 FLX and Solexa DNA sequencing platforms. This study is the first to definitively demonstrate the successful sequencing of picogram quantities of input DNA on the 454 platform, reducing the sample requirement more than 1000-fold without pre-amplification and the associated bias and reduction in library depth. CONCLUSION: The digital PCR assay allows absolute quantification of sequencing libraries, eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of standard curves to PCR-based quantification, and with a coefficient of variation close to 10\%, is sufficiently precise to enable direct sequencing without titration runs.},

  Abstract                 = {The viral reservoir represents a critical challenge for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) eradication strategies. However, it remains unclear when and where the viral reservoir is seeded during acute infection and the extent to which it is susceptible to early antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we show that the viral reservoir is seeded rapidly after mucosal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus monkeys and before systemic viraemia. We initiated suppressive ART in groups of monkeys on days 3, 7, 10 and 14 after intrarectal SIVMAC251 infection. Treatment with ART on day 3 blocked the emergence of viral RNA and proviral DNA in peripheral blood and also substantially reduced levels of proviral DNA in lymph nodes and gastrointestinal mucosa as compared with treatment at later time points. In addition, treatment on day 3 abrogated the induction of SIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Nevertheless, after discontinuation of ART following 24 weeks of fully suppressive therapy, virus rebounded in all animals, although the monkeys that were treated on day 3 exhibited a delayed viral rebound as compared with those treated on days 7, 10 and 14. The time to viral rebound correlated with total viraemia during acute infection and with proviral DNA at the time of ART discontinuation. These data demonstrate that the viral reservoir is seeded rapidly after intrarectal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys, during the 'eclipse' phase, and before detectable viraemia. This strikingly early seeding of the refractory viral reservoir raises important new challenges for HIV-1 eradication strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea. On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a "public health emergency of international concern."By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases, including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported from five countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14.The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age (49.9\% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is 70.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4 days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95\% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for Guinea, 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95\% CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for Guinea, 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95\% CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling times are 15.7 days (95\% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days (95\% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95\% CI, 23.6 to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone, exceeding 20,000 in total.These data indicate that without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) utilizes Vpu, Env, and Nef to down-modulate its primary CD4 receptor from the cell surface, and this function seems to be critical for the pathogenesis of AIDS. The physiological relevance of CD4 down-modulation, however, is currently not well understood. In the present study, we analyzed the kinetics of CD4 down-modulation and the susceptibility of HIV-1-infected T cells to superinfection using proviral HIV-1 constructs containing individual and combined defects in vpu, env, and nef and expressing red or green fluorescent proteins. T cells infected with HIV-1 mutants containing functional nef genes expressed low surface levels of CD4 from the first moment that viral gene expression became detectable. In comparison, Vpu and Env had only minor to moderate effects on CD4 during later stages of infection. Consistent with these quantitative differences, Nef inhibited superinfection more efficiently than Vpu and Env. Notably, nef alleles from AIDS patients were more effective in preventing superinfection than those derived from a nonprogressor of HIV-1 infection. Our data suggest that protection against X4-tropic HIV-1 superinfection involves both CD4-independent and CD4-dependent mechanisms of HIV-1 Nef. X4 was effectively down-regulated by simian immunodeficiency virus and HIV-2 but not by HIV-1 Nef proteins. Thus, maximal protection seems to involve an as-yet-unknown mechanism that is independent of CD4 or coreceptor down-modulation. Finally, we demonstrate that superinfected primary T cells show enhanced levels of apoptosis. Accordingly, one reason that HIV-1 inhibits CD4 surface expression and superinfection is to prevent premature cell death in order to expand the period of effective virus production.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 entry requires the cell surface expression of CD4 and either the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors on host cells. Individuals homozygous for the ccr5Δ32 polymorphism do not express CCR5 and are protected from infection by CCR5-tropic (R5) virus strains. As an approach to inactivating CCR5, we introduced CCR5-specific zinc-finger nucleases into human CD4+ T cells prior to adoptive transfer, but the need to protect cells from virus strains that use CXCR4 (X4) in place of or in addition to CCR5 (R5X4) remains. Here we describe engineering a pair of zinc finger nucleases that, when introduced into human T cells, efficiently disrupt cxcr4 by cleavage and error-prone non-homologous DNA end-joining. The resulting cells proliferated normally and were resistant to infection by X4-tropic HIV-1 strains. CXCR4 could also be inactivated in ccr5Δ32 CD4+ T cells, and we show that such cells were resistant to all strains of HIV-1 tested. Loss of CXCR4 also provided protection from X4 HIV-1 in a humanized mouse model, though this protection was lost over time due to the emergence of R5-tropic viral mutants. These data suggest that CXCR4-specific ZFNs may prove useful in establishing resistance to CXCR4-tropic HIV for autologous transplant in HIV-infected individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent data from several organisms indicate that the transcribed portions of genomes are larger and more complex than expected, and that many functional properties of transcripts are based not on coding sequences but on regulatory sequences in untranslated regions or non-coding RNAs. Alternative start and polyadenylation sites and regulation of intron splicing add additional dimensions to the rich transcriptional output. This transcriptional complexity has been sampled mainly using hybridization-based methods under one or few experimental conditions. Here we applied direct high-throughput sequencing of complementary DNAs (RNA-Seq), supplemented with data from high-density tiling arrays, to globally sample transcripts of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, independently from available gene annotations. We interrogated transcriptomes under multiple conditions, including rapid proliferation, meiotic differentiation and environmental stress, as well as in RNA processing mutants to reveal the dynamic plasticity of the transcriptional landscape as a function of environmental, developmental and genetic factors. High-throughput sequencing proved to be a powerful and quantitative method to sample transcriptomes deeply at maximal resolution. In contrast to hybridization, sequencing showed little, if any, background noise and was sensitive enough to detect widespread transcription in >90\% of the genome, including traces of RNAs that were not robustly transcribed or rapidly degraded. The combined sequencing and strand-specific array data provide rich condition-specific information on novel, mostly non-coding transcripts, untranslated regions and gene structures, thus improving the existing genome annotation. Sequence reads spanning exon-exon or exon-intron junctions give unique insight into a surprising variability in splicing efficiency across introns, genes and conditions. Splicing efficiency was largely coordinated with transcript levels, and increased transcription led to increased splicing in test genes. Hundreds of introns showed such regulated splicing during cellular proliferation or differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {CD4 is an integral membrane glycoprotein which is known as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receptor for infection of human cells. The protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently transported to the cell surface via the Golgi complex. HIV infection of CD4+ cells leads to downmodulation of cell surface CD4, due at least in part to the formation of stable intracellular complexes between CD4 and the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Env precursor polyprotein gp160. This process "traps" both proteins in the ER, leading to reduced surface expression of CD4 and reduced processing of gp160 to gp120 and gp41. We have recently demonstrated that the presence of the HIV-1-encoded integral membrane protein Vpu can reduce the formation of Env-CD4 complexes, resulting in increased gp160 processing and decreased CD4 stability. We have studied the effect of Vpu on CD4 stability and found that Vpu induces rapid degradation of CD4, reducing the half-life of CD4 from 6 h to 12 min. By using a CD4-binding mutant of gp160, we were able to show that this Vpu-induced degradation of CD4 requires retention of CD4 in the ER, which is normally accomplished through its binding to gp160. The involvement of gp160 in the induction of CD4 degradation is restricted to its function as a CD4 trap, since, in the absence of Env, an ER retention mutant of CD4, as well as wild-type CD4 in cultures treated with brefeldin A, a drug that blocks transport of proteins from the ER, is degraded in the presence of Vpu.},

It is essential for cells to respond adequately to different stresses including growth factor deprivation, products of the inflammatory response (TNF) and bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) and viral (dsRNA) products. As a vital component of the cellular antiviral response pathway, PKR is autophosphorylated and activated on binding to dsRNA. This results in inhibition of protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and also induces transcription of inflammatory genes by PKR-dependent signaling of the activation of different transcription factors. Along with RNaseL, PKR constitutes the antiviral arm of a group of mammalian stress response proteins that have counterparts in yeast. What began as adaptation to amino acid deprivation and sensing unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum has evolved into a family of sophisticated mammalian stress response proteins able to mediate cellular responses to both physical and biological stress.},

While small in number, these latently infected cells form a drug-insensitive reservoir that importantly contributes to the life-long persistence of HIV despite highly effective antiviral therapy. In tissue culture, latent HIV proviruses can be activated when their cellular hosts are exposed to select proinflammatory cytokines or their T-cell receptors are ligated. However, due to a lack of potency and/or dose-limiting toxicity, attempts to purge virus from this latent reservoir in vivo with immune-activating agents, such as anti-CD3 antibodies and IL-2, have failed. A deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of HIV latency is clearly required, including determining whether viral latency is actively reinforced by transcriptional repressors, defining which inducible host transcription factors most effectively antagonize latency, and elucidating the role of chromatin in viral latency. Only through such an improved understanding will it be possible to identify combination therapies that might allow complete purging of the latent reservoir and to realize the difficult and elusive goal of complete eradication of HIV in infected patients.},

We have previously shown that such cells exhibit an aberrant pattern of viral RNA expression, with a large excess of fully spliced viral RNAs. Here, by superinfecting the ACH2 cells with a second HIV-1 virus, we demonstrate the primary mechanism of HIV-1 proviral latency in this cell line. In the dually infected cells, the exogenous virus was transcribed at high levels. However, expression from the provirus originally present in the ACH2 cells was not quantitatively increased. Still, its RNA production was shifted from a blocked early-stage to a fully productive pattern. This was interpreted to be a consequence of the high levels of Rev produced by the exogenous virus, acting in trans to promote the cytoplasmic export of all incompletely spliced viral mRNAs made in the cells. Comparable numbers of copies of each provirus were present in the dually infected cells, and both viruses grew equally well, once passed onto fresh cells. These results indicate that the low levels of transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 virus present in ACH2 cells are secondary to specific characteristics of the region of the cellular genome in which the proviral DNA is integrated.},

  Abstract                 = {Owing to the present global biodiversity crisis, the biodiversity–stability relationship and the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have become major topics in ecology1, 2, 3. Biodiversity is a complex term that includes taxonomic, functional, spatial and temporal aspects of organismic diversity, with species richness (the number of species) and evenness (the relative abundance of species) considered among the most important measures4, 5. With few exceptions (see, for example, ref. 6), the majority of studies of biodiversity-functioning and biodiversity–stability theory have predominantly examined richness7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here we show, using microbial microcosms, that initial community evenness is a key factor in preserving the functional stability of an ecosystem. Using experimental manipulations of both richness and initial evenness in microcosms with denitrifying bacterial communities, we found that the stability of the net ecosystem denitrification in the face of salinity stress was strongly influenced by the initial evenness of the community. Therefore, when communities are highly uneven, or there is extreme dominance by one or a few species, their functioning is less resistant to environmental stress. Further unravelling how evenness influences ecosystem processes in natural and humanized environments constitutes a major future conceptual challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing is a highly regulated process that greatly increases the proteome diversity and plays an important role in cellular differentiation and disease. Interactions between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and pre-mRNA are the principle regulator of splicing decisions. Findings from recent genome-wide studies of protein-RNA interactions have been combined with assays of the global effects of RBPs on splicing to create RNA splicing maps. These maps integrate information from all pre-mRNAs regulated by single RBPs to identify the global positioning principles guiding splicing regulation. Recent studies using this approach have identified a set of positional principles that are shared between diverse RBPs. Here, we discuss how insights from RNA splicing maps of different RBPs inform the mechanistic models of splicing regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:HIV-1-infected elite controllers or suppressors (ES) maintain undetectable viral loads (< 50 copies/mL) without antiretroviral therapy. The mechanisms of suppression are incompletely understood. Modulation of HIV-1 replication by miRNAs has been reported, but the role of small RNAs in ES is unknown. Using samples from a well-characterized ES cohort, untreated viremic patients, and uninfected controls, we explored the PBMC miRNA profile and probed the relationships of miRNA expression, CD4+ T-cell counts, and viral load.miRNA profiles, obtained using multiple acquisition, data processing, and analysis methods, distinguished ES and uninfected controls from viremic HIV-1-infected patients. For several miRNAs, however, ES and viremic patients shared similar expression patterns. Differentially expressed miRNAs included those with reported roles in HIV-1 latency (miR-29 family members, miRs -125b and -150). Others, such as miR-31 and miR-31*, had no previously reported connection with HIV-1 infection but were found here to differ significantly with uncontrolled HIV-1 replication. Correlations of miRNA expression with CD4+ T-cell count and viral load were found, and we observed that ES with low CD4+ T-cell counts had miRNA profiles more closely related to viremic patients than controls. However, expression patterns indicate that miRNA variability cannot be explained solely by CD4+ T-cell variation.The intimate involvement of miRNAs in disease processes is underscored by connections of miRNA expression with the HIV disease clinical parameters of CD4 count and plasma viral load. However, miRNA profile changes are not explained completely by these variables. Significant declines of miRs-125b and -150, among others, in both ES and viremic patients indicate the persistence of host miRNA responses or ongoing effects of infection despite viral suppression by ES. We found no negative correlations with viral load in viremic patients, not even those that have been reported to silence HIV-1 in vitro, suggesting that the effects of these miRNAs are exerted in a focused, cell-type-specific manner. Finally, the observation that some ES with low CD4 counts were consistently related to viremic patients suggests that miRNAs may serve as biomarkers for risk of disease progression even in the presence of viral suppression.},

The crystal structure of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease has been determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution (R factor of 0.184) with the use of a model based on the Rous sarcoma virus protease structure. In this enzymatically active protein, the cysteines were replaced by alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, a nongenetically coded amino acid. This structure, in which all 99 amino acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by others. The interface between the identical subunits forming the active protease dimer is composed of four well-ordered beta strands from both the amino and carboxyl termini and residues 86 to 94 have a helical conformation. The observed arrangement of the dimer interface suggests possible designs for dimerization inhibitors.},

To obtain a global view of the signaling events induced during HIV-1 entry, we conducted a quantitative phosphoproteomics screen of primary human CD4(+) T cells after infection with an HIV-1 strain that engages the receptors CD4 and CXCR4. We quantified 1,757 phosphorylation sites with high stringency. The abundance of 239 phosphorylation sites from 175 genes, including several proteins in pathways known to be impacted by HIV-receptor binding, changed significantly within a minute after HIV-1 exposure. Several previously uncharacterized HIV-1 host factors were also identified and confirmed through RNAi depletion studies. Surprisingly, five serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins involved in messenger RNA splicing, including the splicing factor SRm300 (SRRM2), were differentially phosophorylated. Mechanistic studies with SRRM2 suggest that HIV-1 modulates host cell alternative splicing machinery during entry in order to facilitate virus replication and release.},

  Abstract                 = {The human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) types 1 and 2 originated independently and are related to distinct lineages of simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLV-1 and STLV-2, respectively). These facts, along with the finding that HTLV-1 diversity appears to have resulted from multiple cross-species transmissions of STLV-1, suggest that contact between humans and infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) may result in HTLV emergence. We investigated the diversity of HTLV among central Africans reporting contact with NHP blood and body fluids through hunting, butchering, and keeping primate pets. We show that this population is infected with a wide variety of HTLVs, including two previously unknown retroviruses: HTLV-4 is a member of a phylogenetic lineage that is distinct from all known HTLVs and STLVs; HTLV-3 falls within the phylogenetic diversity of STLV-3, a group not previously seen in humans. We also document human infection with multiple STLV-1-like viruses. These results demonstrate greater HTLV diversity than previously recognized and suggest that NHP exposure contributes to HTLV emergence. Our discovery of unique and divergent HTLVs has implications for HTLV diagnosis, blood screening, and potential disease development in infected persons. The findings also indicate that cross-species transmission is not the rate-limiting step in pandemic retrovirus emergence and suggest that it may be possible to predict and prevent disease emergence by surveillance of populations exposed to animal reservoirs and interventions to decrease risk factors, such as primate hunting.},

Questionnaire data were collected to assess whether persons kept wild animal pets; hunted and butchered wild game; had experienced bites, scratches, or injuries from live animals; or had been injured during hunting or butchering. While all villages had substantial exposure to nonhuman primates, higher rates of exposure were seen in lowland forest sites. The study demonstrates that exposure is not limited to small groups of hunters.

In promoters, multiple sequence elements cooperate as functional modules, which in combination determine overall promoter activity. We previously developed computational tools based on this hierarchical structure for in silico promoter analysis. Here we address the functional organization of post-transcriptional control elements, using the HIV-1 genome as a model. Numerous mutagenesis studies demonstrate that expression of HIV structural proteins is restricted by inhibitory sequences (INS) in HIV mRNAs in the absence of the HIV-1 Rev protein. However, previous attempts to detect conserved sequence patterns of HIV-1 INS have failed. We defined four distinct sequence patterns for inhibitory motifs (weight matrices), which identified 22 out of the 25 known INS as well as several new candidate INS regions contained in numerous HIV-1 strains. The conservation of INS motifs within the HIV genome was not due to overall sequence conservation. The functionality of two candidate INS regions was analyzed with a new assay that measures the effect of non-coding mRNA sequences on production of red fluorescent reporter protein. Both new INS regions showed inhibitory activity in sense but not in antisense orientation. Inhibitory activity increased by combining both INS regions in the same mRNA. Inhibitory activity of known and new INS regions was overcome by co-expression of the HIV-1 Rev protein.},

  Abstract                 = {The Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) division of GenBank, dbEST, is a large repository of the data being generated by human genome sequencing centers. ESTs are short, single pass cDNA sequences generated from randomly selected library clones. The approximately 415 000 human ESTs represent a valuable, low priced, and easily accessible biological reagent. As many ESTs are derived from yet uncharacterized genes, dbEST is a prime starting point for the identification of novel mRNAs. Conversely, other genes are represented by hundreds of ESTs, a redundancy which may provide data about rare mRNA isoforms. Here we present an analysis of >1000 ESTs generated by the WashU-Merck EST project. These ESTs were collected by querying dbEST with the genomic sequences of 15 human genes. When we aligned the matching ESTs to the genomic sequences, we found that in one gene, 73\% of the ESTs which derive from spliced or partially spliced transcripts either contain intron sequences or are spliced at previously unreported sites; other genes have lower percentages of such ESTs, and some have none. This finding suggests that ESTs could provide researchers with novel information about alternative splicing in certain genes. In a related analysis of pairs of ESTs which are reported to derive from a single gene, we found that as many as 26\% of the pairs do not BOTH align with the sequence of the same gene. We suspect that some of these unusual ESTs result from artifacts in EST generation, and caution researchers that they may find such clones while analyzing sequences in dbEST.},

Analyses of semiannual blood samples obtained from six infected men showed that a rapid rate of CD4 T cell loss was associated with relative evolutionary stasis of the HIV-1 quasispecies virus population. More moderate rates of CD4 T cell loss correlated with genetic evolution within three of four subjects. Consistent with selection by the immune constraints of these subjects, amino acid changes were apparent within the appropriate epitopes of human leukocyte antigen class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by the HIV-1 quasispecies virus populations under natural selection are compatible with adaptive evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA processing plays a critical role in the replication of HIV-1, regulated in part through the action of host SR proteins. To explore the impact of modulating SR protein activity on virus replication, the effect of increasing or inhibiting the activity of the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK) family of SR protein kinases on HIV-1 expression and RNA processing was examined.Despite their high homology, increasing individual CLK expression had distinct effects on HIV-1, CLK1 enhancing Gag production while CLK2 inhibited the virus. Parallel studies on the anti-HIV-1 activity of CLK inhibitors revealed a similar discrepant effect on HIV-1 expression. TG003, an inhibitor of CLK1, 2 and 4, had no effect on viral Gag synthesis while chlorhexidine, a CLK2, 3 and 4 inhibitor, blocked virus production. Chlorhexidine treatment altered viral RNA processing, decreasing levels of unspliced and single spliced viral RNAs, and reduced Rev accumulation. Subsequent experiments in the context of HIV-1 replication in PBMCs confirmed the capacity of chlorhexidine to suppress virus replication.Together, these findings establish that HIV-1 RNA processing can be targeted to suppress virus replication as demonstrated by manipulating individual CLK function and identified chlorhexidine as a lead compound in the development of novel anti-viral therapies.},

Of the drugs tested, digoxin was found to induce a dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 structural protein synthesis, a response due, in part, to reduced accumulation of the corresponding viral mRNAs. In addition, digoxin altered viral RNA splice site use, resulting in loss of the essential viral factor Rev. Digoxin induced changes in activity of the CLK family of SR protein kinases and modification of several SR proteins, including SRp20 and Tra2β, which could account for the effects observed. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of SRp20 elicited changes in HIV-1 RNA processing similar to those observed with digoxin. Importantly, digoxin was also highly active against clinical strains of HIV-1 in vitro, validating this novel approach to treatment of this infection.},

We now demonstrate that there is an eighth gene which encodes a protein which is immunogenic and recognized by sera of some HTLV-III seropositive people. The gene is highly conserved among all known HTLV-III isolates and exhibits a polymorphism at the 3' end which distinguishes several molecular clones of the HTLV-IIIB cell line from those of other HTLV-III/LAV isolates.

  Abstract                 = {Single point mutations at both synonymous and non-synonymous positions within exons can have severe effects on gene function through disruption of splicing. Predicting these mutations in silico purely from the genomic sequence is difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the multiple factors that may be responsible. In addition, little is known about which computational prediction approaches, such as those involving exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers, are most informative.We assessed the features of single-nucleotide genomic variants verified to cause exon skipping and compared them to a large set of coding SNPs common in the human population, which are likely to have no effect on splicing. Our findings implicate a number of features important for their ability to discriminate splice-affecting variants, including the naturally occurring density of exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers of the exon and intronic environment, extensive changes in the number of predicted exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers, proximity to the splice junctions and evolutionary constraint of the region surrounding the variant. By extending this approach to additional datasets, we also identified relevant features of variants that cause increased exon inclusion and ectopic splice site activation.We identified a number of features that have statistically significant representation among exonic variants that modulate splicing. These analyses highlight putative mechanisms responsible for splicing outcome and emphasize the role of features important for exon definition. We developed a web-tool, Skippy, to score coding variants for these relevant splice-modulating features.},

A viral sequence from 1959 (ZR59) is the oldest known HIV-1 infection. Other historically documented sequences, important calibration points to convert evolutionary distance into time, are lacking, however; ZR59 is the only one sampled before 1976. Here we report the amplification and characterization of viral sequences from a Bouin's-fixed paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsy specimen obtained in 1960 from an adult female in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)), and we use them to conduct the first comparative evolutionary genetic study of early pre-AIDS epidemic HIV-1 group M viruses. Phylogenetic analyses position this viral sequence (DRC60) closest to the ancestral node of subtype A (excluding A2). Relaxed molecular clock analyses incorporating DRC60 and ZR59 date the most recent common ancestor of the M group to near the beginning of the twentieth century. The sizeable genetic distance between DRC60 and ZR59 directly demonstrates that diversification of HIV-1 in west-central Africa occurred long before the recognized AIDS pandemic. The recovery of viral gene sequences from decades-old paraffin-embedded tissues opens the door to a detailed palaeovirological investigation of the evolutionary history of HIV-1 that is not accessible by other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {To illustrate the methods employed in gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays, infection of CD4+ T cell lines with HIV-1LAI is used to identify expression changes relevant to in vitro HIV-1 infection. Cell lines are infected at a high multiplicity of infection to ensure a population of near-synchronously infected cells to be compared to uninfected cells. Infection status is verified using flow cytometry to determine the intracellular expression of the viral gag p24 protein before samples are harvested for total RNA extraction. Total RNA is extracted and amplified using commercially available kits, and RNA quality is verified using Bioanalyzer technology. To obtain fluorescently labeled cDNA probes, the amplified RNA is reverse-transcribed to yield cDNA, using random nonamers in the presence of dye-labeled dCTP. After first-strand cDNA synthesis, RNA is degraded and the probes are purified. For each infection condition (LAI and mock), two slides are hybridized with identical probes generated from the same RNAs, but with fluorescent labels reversed on one of the slides to control for dye-specific effects. Troubleshooting strategies and issues to consider prior to starting the experiment are discussed in detail in the notes section.},

We found that several classes of genes were inhibited by HIV-1(BRU) infection, consistent with the G(2) arrest of HIV-1-infected cells induced by Vpr. These included genes involved in cell division and transcription, a family of DEAD-box proteins (RNA helicases), and all genes involved in translation and splicing. However, the overall level of cell activation and signaling was increased in infected cells, consistent with strong virus production. These included a subgroup of transcription factors, including EGR1 and JUN, suggesting they play a specific role in the HIV-1 life cycle. Some regulatory changes were cell line specific; however, the majority, including enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, of changes were regulated in most infected cell lines. Compendium analysis comparing gene expression profiles of our HIV-1 infection experiments to those of cells exposed to heat shock, interferon, or influenza A virus indicated that HIV-1 infection largely induced specific changes rather than simply activating stress response or cytokine response pathways. Thus, microarray analysis confirmed several known HIV-1 host cell interactions and permitted identification of specific cellular pathways not previously implicated in HIV-1 infection. Continuing analyses are expected to suggest strategies for impacting HIV-1 replication in vivo by targeting these pathways.},

The results with reticulocyte lysates differed from those obtained in the L-cell-free system in that (a) a different RNA cleavage pattern was produced (with added L-cell ribosomes) and (b) cleavage was fully activated by the analogue ppp(A2'p)3A3'pCp. As might be expected from the relatively high levels of 2-5A present in interferon-treated, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC)-infected L-cells, rRNA extracted from these cells was also cleaved. The cleavage pattern observed overlapped with that obtained on incubation of an L-cell-free system with 2-5A.

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a pre-mRNA maturation process leading to the expression of multiple mRNA variants from the same primary transcript. More than 90\% of human genes are expressed via AS. Therefore, quantifying the inclusion level of every exon is crucial for generating accurate transcriptomic maps and studying the regulation of AS.Here we introduce SpliceTrap, a method to quantify exon inclusion levels using paired-end RNA-seq data. Unlike other tools, which focus on full-length transcript isoforms, SpliceTrap approaches the expression-level estimation of each exon as an independent Bayesian inference problem. In addition, SpliceTrap can identify major classes of alternative splicing events under a single cellular condition, without requiring a background set of reads to estimate relative splicing changes. We tested SpliceTrap both by simulation and real data analysis, and compared it to state-of-the-art tools for transcript quantification. SpliceTrap demonstrated improved accuracy, robustness and reliability in quantifying exon-inclusion ratios.SpliceTrap is a useful tool to study alternative splicing regulation, especially for accurate quantification of local exon-inclusion ratios from RNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SpliceTrap can be implemented online through the CSH Galaxy server http://cancan.cshl.edu/splicetrap and is also available for download and installation at http://rulai.cshl.edu/splicetrap/.michael.zhang@utdallas.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The numerical decline of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells affects the optimal ratio between the two cell types necessary for immune regulation. Therefore, this work aimed to define the genomic basis of HIV interactions with the cellular transcriptome of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.Genome-wide transcriptomes of primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from HIV+ patients were analyzed at different stages of HIV disease using Illumina microarray. For each cell subset, pairwise comparisons were performed and differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified (fold change >2 and B-statistic >0) followed by quantitative PCR validation. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of DE genes revealed enriched categories of complement activation, actin filament, proteasome core and proton-transporting ATPase complex. By gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a network of enriched pathways functionally connected by mitochondria was identified in both T cell subsets as a transcriptional signature of HIV disease progression. These pathways ranged from metabolism and energy production (TCA cycle and OXPHOS) to mitochondria meditated cell apoptosis and cell cycle dysregulation. The most unique and significant feature of our work was that the non-progressing status in HIV+ long-term non-progressors was associated with MAPK, WNT, and AKT pathways contributing to cell survival and anti-viral responses.These data offer new comparative insights into HIV disease progression from the aspect of HIV-host interactions at the transcriptomic level, which will facilitate the understanding of the genetic basis of transcriptomic interaction of HIV in vivo and how HIV subverts the human gene machinery at the individual cell type level.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq technology based on next-generation sequencing provides the unprecedented ability of studying transcriptomes at high resolution and accuracy, and the potential of measuring expression of multiple isoforms from the same gene at high precision. Solved by maximum likelihood estimation, isoform expression can be inferred in RNA-Seq using statistical models based on the assumption that sequenced reads are distributed uniformly along transcripts. Modification of the model is needed when considering situations where RNA-Seq data do not follow uniform distribution. RESULTS: We proposed two curves, the global bias curve (GBC) and the local bias curves (LBCs), to describe the non-uniformity of read distributions for all genes in a transcriptome and for each gene, respectively. Incorporating the bias curves into the uniform read distribution (URD) model, we introduced non-URD (N-URD) models to infer isoform expression levels. On a series of systematic simulation studies, the proposed models outperform the original model in recovering major isoforms and the expression ratio of alternative isoforms. We also applied the new model to real RNA-Seq datasets and found that its inferences on expression ratios of alternative isoforms are more reasonable. The experiments indicate that incorporating N-URD information can improve the accuracy in modeling and inferring isoform expression in RNA-Seq.},

First, IBD has been found to be the most tractable of complex disorders for discovering susceptibility genes, and these have shown the importance of epithelial barrier function, and innate and adaptive immunity in disease pathogenesis. Second, efforts directed towards the identification of environmental factors implicate commensal bacteria (or their products), rather than conventional pathogens, as drivers of dysregulated immunity and IBD. Third, murine models, which exhibit many of the features of ulcerative colitis and seem to be bacteria-driven, have helped unravel the pathogenesis/mucosal immunopathology of IBD.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV-1 Tat has pleiotropic functions. While its most studied role is to activate transcription from the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter, Tat also has functions as a secretable growth factor, a T-cell activator, and an inducer of cellular apoptosis, amongst others. For its transcriptional function, the first coding exon of Tat appears wholly sufficient; however, lentiviruses (HIVs and SIVs) maintain and conserve a second coding exon for Tat. While the function(s) of the second exon of Tat has remained largely unknown, its integrity in lentiviral genomes suggests biological importance, possibly a role in non-transcriptional activities. To understand better the biology of the second exon of Tat in HIV-1 infection of cells, we have searched for cellular proteins that bind specifically to this protein domain. Here, we report that the human translation elongation factor 1-delta (EF-1 delta) binds to the second exon of HIV-1 Tat. Interaction between Tat and EF-1 delta dramatically reduces the efficiency of the translation of cellular, but not viral, mRNAs. These findings suggest that a non-transcriptional activity of Tat modulates cellular protein synthesis, thereby affecting the metabolism of host cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, it was proposed that alternative splicing may act as a mechanism for opening accelerated paths of evolution, by reducing negative selection pressure, but there has been little evidence so far that this mechanism could produce adaptive benefit. Here, we use metrics of very different types of selection pressures [e.g., against amino acid mutations (Ka/Ks), against mutations at synonymous sites (Ks), and for protein reading-frame preservation] to address this question by genomewide analyses of human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat. These data show that alternative splicing relaxes Ka/Ks selection pressure up to 7-fold, but intriguingly this effect is accompanied by a strong increase in selection pressure against synonymous mutations, which propagates into the adjacent intron, and correlates strongly with the alternative splicing level observed for each exon. These effects are highly local to the alternatively spliced exon. Comparisons of these four genomes consistently show an increase in the density of amino acid mutations (Ka) in alternatively spliced exons and a decrease in the density of synonymous mutations (Ks). This selection pressure against synonymous mutations in alternatively spliced exons was accompanied in all four genomes by a striking increase in selection pressure for protein reading-frame preservation, and both increased markedly with increasing evolutionary age. Restricting our analysis to a subset of exons with strong evidence for biologically functional alternative splicing produced identical results. Thus alternative splicing apparently can create evolutionary "hotspots" within a protein sequence, and these events have evidently been selected for during mammalian evolution.},

An important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a 'splicing code' that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell types by features derived from RNA, DNA and epigenetic modifiers.We formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical inference and introduce a Bayesian method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden variables to combine subgroups of features into a network, allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a Gibbs sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical significance of identified features.Using data for 3665 cassette exons, 1014 RNA features and 4 tissue types derived from 27 mouse tissues (http://genes.toronto.edu/wasp), we benchmarked several methods. Our method outperforms all others, and achieves relative improvements of 52\% in splicing code quality and up to 22\% in classification error, compared with the state of the art.

The widely used notion of similarity of two strings with different lengths is the weighted Levenshtein distance (WLD), which implies the minimum total weights of single symbol insertions, deletions and substitutions required to transform one string into another. In order to incorporate prior knowledge of strings into kernels used in support vector machine and other kernel machines, we utilize variants of this distance to replace distance measure in the RBF and exponential kernels and inner product in polynomial and sigmoid kernels, and form a new class of string kernels: Levenshtein kernels in this paper. Combining our new kernels with support vector machine, the error rate and variance on UCI splice site recognition dataset over 20 run is 5.88∓0.53, which is better than the best result 9.5∓0.7 from other five training algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {During HIV/SIV infection, there is widespread programmed cell death in infected and, perhaps more importantly, uninfected cells. Much of this apoptosis is mediated by Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) interactions. Previously we demonstrated in macaques that induction of FasL expression and apoptotic cell death of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by SIV is dependent on a functional nef gene. However, the molecular mechanism whereby HIV-1 induces the expression of FasL remained poorly understood. Here we report a direct association of HIV-1 Nef with the zeta chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex and the requirement of both proteins for HIV-mediated upregulation of FasL. Expression of FasL through Nef depended upon the integrity of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the TCR zeta chain. Conformation for the importance of zeta for Nef-mediated signaling in T cells came from an independent finding. A single ITAM motif of zeta but not CD3epsilon was both required and sufficient to promote activation and binding of the Nef-associated kinase (NAK/p62). Our data imply that Nef can form a signaling complex with the TCR, which bypasses the requirement of antigen to initiate T cell activation and subsequently upregulation of FasL expression. Thus, our study may provide critical insights into the molecular mechanism whereby the HIV-1 accessory protein Nef contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent transcriptome analysis indicates that > 90\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, underscoring the contribution of differential RNA processing to diverse proteomes in higher eukaryotic cells. The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein PTB is a well-characterized splicing repressor, but PTB knockdown causes both exon inclusion and skipping. Genome-wide mapping of PTB-RNA interactions and construction of a functional RNA map now reveal that dominant PTB binding near a competing constitutive splice site generally induces exon inclusion, whereas prevalent binding close to an alternative site often causes exon skipping. This positional effect was further demonstrated by disrupting or creating a PTB-binding site on minigene constructs and testing their responses to PTB knockdown or overexpression. These findings suggest a mechanism for PTB to modulate splice site competition to produce opposite functional consequences, which may be generally applicable to RNA-binding splicing factors to positively or negatively regulate alternative splicing in mammalian cells.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the genetic diversity and potential mosaic genomes of HIV-1 during the early part of the HIV-1 epidemic among commercial sex workers (CSWs) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). Serologic analysis revealed that 27 (28.7\%) of the 94 specimens were seropositive by both peptide and whole-virus lysate EIAs and that 24 were positive by molecular screening assays, using generic primers that can detect all known groups of HIV-1. Phylogenetic analyses of the gag(p24), C2V3, and gp41 regions of these 24 specimens showed that all were group M; none of them had any evidence of group O, N, or SIVcpz-like sequences. On the basis of env sequence analysis, the 24 group M specimens were classified as subtypes G (37.5\%), A (21\%), F1 (12.5\%), CRF01_AE (8\%), D (4\%), and H (4\%); 3 (12.5\%) were unclassifiable (U). Similar analysis of the gag(p24) region revealed that the majority of infections were subtype A; however, one-third of the specimens were subtype G. Parallel analysis of gag(p24) and env regions revealed discordant subtypes in many specimens that may reflect possible dual and/or recombinant viruses. These data suggest a predominance of subtype G (both pure G and recombinant CRF02_AG) during the early part of the epidemic in Kinshasa. Infections with group N or SIVcpz-like viruses were not present among these CSWs in Kinshasa.},

We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing affects a majority of human genes and plays important roles in development and disease. Alternative splicing (AS) events conserved since the divergence of human and mouse are likely of primary biological importance, but relatively few of such events are known. Here we describe sequence features that distinguish exons subject to evolutionarily conserved AS, which we call alternative conserved exons (ACEs), from other orthologous human/mouse exons and integrate these features into an exon classification algorithm, acescan. Genome-wide analysis of annotated orthologous human-mouse exon pairs identified approximately 2,000 predicted ACEs. Alternative splicing was verified in both human and mouse tissues by using an RT-PCR-sequencing protocol for 21 of 30 (70\%) predicted ACEs tested, supporting the validity of a majority of acescan predictions. By contrast, AS was observed in mouse tissues for only 2 of 15 (13\%) tested exons that had EST or cDNA evidence of AS in human but were not predicted ACEs, and AS was never observed for 11 negative control exons in human or mouse tissues. Predicted ACEs were much more likely to preserve the reading frame and less likely to disrupt protein domains than other AS events and were enriched in genes expressed in the brain and in genes involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and development. Our results also imply that the vast majority of AS events represented in the human EST database are not conserved in mouse.},

Recent studies suggest that cellular miRNAs may serve to control the replication of viruses in cells. If such is the case, viruses might be expected to evolve the ability to modulate the expression of cellular miRNAs. To ask if expression of HIV-1 genes changes the miRNA profiles in human cells, we employed a high throughput microarray method, termed the RNA-primed Array-based Klenow Enzyme (RAKE) assay. Here, we describe the optimization of this assay to quantify the expression of miRNAs in HIV-1 transfected human cells. We report distinct differences in miRNA profiles in mock-transfected HeLa cells versus HeLa cells transfected with an infectious HIV-1 molecular clone, pNL4-3.},

The effect of VPA on resting CD4 T cell phenotype was measured by flow cytometric analysis, and its effect on de novo HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured ex vivo. Outgrowth of HIV from resting CD4 T cells of aviremic, HIV-infected donors treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy was compared in limiting-dilution cultures after mitogen stimulation or exposure to VPA.VPA induced acetylation at the integrated HIV proviral promoter, but CD4 cells exposed to VPA did not become activated or more permissive for de novo HIV infection. VPA induced outgrowth of HIV from the resting CD4 cells of aviremic patients at concentrations achievable in vivo as frequently as did mitogen stimulation.With advances in antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection might be cleared by intensive time-limited treatment coupled with practical strategies that disrupt latency without enhancing new infection. HDAC inhibitors are capable of inducing expression of quiescent provirus, without fully activating cells or enhancing de novo infection, and may be useful in future clinical protocols that seek to eradicate HIV infection.},

Here we report whole-exome sequencing of 29 myelodysplasia specimens, which unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF3B1. In a large series analysis, these splicing pathway mutations were frequent (∼45 to ∼85\%) in, and highly specific to, myeloid neoplasms showing features of myelodysplasia. Conspicuously, most of the mutations, which occurred in a mutually exclusive manner, affected genes involved in the 3'-splice site recognition during pre-mRNA processing, inducing abnormal RNA splicing and compromised haematopoiesis. Our results provide the first evidence indicating that genetic alterations of the major splicing components could be involved in human pathogenesis, also implicating a novel therapeutic possibility for myelodysplasia.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of myristoylation on p27nef subcellular distribution and suppression of HIV-1 transcription was examined by transfecting COS-7 cells with plasmids expressing either myristoylated (pSVnef) or nonmyristolyated p27nef (pSVnefala2). Similar levels of myristoylated and nonmyristoylated p27nef were expressed with only the product of the pSVnef plasmid being myristoylated. Immuno-histochemical microscopy and radioimmunoprecipitation revealed myristolyated p27nef only in the membrane fraction while nonmyristolyated p27nef was found distributed between the nucleus and the cytosol fractions. The effect of myristoylation on p27nef suppression of HIV LTR controlled transcription was examined in transient transfected COS cells and in CEM human T-cell clones consituitively expressing either myristolyated or nonmyristolyated p27nef by cotransfecting with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid under control of the HIV-1 LTR. In both systems, myristoylated p27nef exhibited a 13- to 18-fold inhibition of basal CAT activity while the nonmyristolyated mutant and the same plasmid carrying the nef gene in a reverse orientation inhibited CAT activity one- to two-fold. These results confirm the cytoplasmic membrane localization of p27nef and establish that its subcellular targeting is dependent on covalently attached myristate. The data also provide further evidence that p27nef acts as a transcriptional suppressor and establishes for the first time that myristolyation is required for the full manifestation of this effect.},

We report that Vif interacts with cellular proteins Cul5, elongins B and C, and Rbx1 to form an Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF)-like complex. The ability of Vif to suppress antiviral activity of APOBEC3G was specifically dependent on Cul5-SCF function, allowing Vif to interact with APOBEC3G and induce its ubiquitination and degradation. A Vif mutant that interacted with APOBEC3G but not with Cul5-SCF was functionally inactive. The Cul5-SCF was also required for Vif function in distantly related simian immunodeficiency virus mac. These results indicate that the conserved Cul5-SCF pathway used by Vif is a potential target for antiviral development.},

  Abstract                 = {The solitary ERV-9 long terminal repeat (LTR) located upstream of the HS5 site in the human beta-globin locus control region exhibits prominent enhancer activity in embryonic and erythroid cells. The LTR enhancer contains 14 tandemly repeated subunits with recurrent CCAAT, GTGGGGA, and GATA motifs. Here we showed that in erythroid K562 cells these DNA motifs bound the following three transcription factors: ubiquitous NF-Y and hematopoietic MZF1 and GATA-2. These factors and their target DNA motifs exhibited a hierarchy of DNA/protein and protein/protein binding affinities: NF-Y/CCAAT > NF-Y/GATA-2 > NF-Y/MZF1 > MZF1/GTGGGGA; GATA-2/GATA. Through protein/protein interactions, NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motif recruited MZF1 and GATA-2, but not Sp1 and GATA-1, and stabilized their binding to the neighboring GTGGGGA and GATA sites to assemble a novel LTR enhancer complex, NF-Y/MZF1/GATA-2. In the LTR-HS5-epsilonp-GFP plasmid integrated into K562 cells, mutation of the CCAAT motif in the LTR enhancer to abolish NF-Y binding inactivated the enhancer, closed down the chromatin structure of the epsilon-globin promoter, and silenced transcription of the green fluorescent protein gene. The results indicated that NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motifs assembled a robust LTR enhancer complex, which could act over the intervening DNA to remodel the chromatin structure and to stimulate the transcription of the downstream gene locus.},

This protein was not detected in cells infected with a virus having a truncated vpr gene that lacks the potential to encode for 26 C-terminal amino acid residues.

Using samples from five individuals who were started on ART within 6 months of infection and achieved a viral load <50 (suppressed), we isolated one- and two-exon tat RNA from HIV propagated ex vivo from baseline plasma and from co-cultures of CD4+ T cells obtained at baseline and suppressed time points. Compared to virus from the baseline plasma (mostly from productively-infected CD4+ T cells), virus from the baseline and suppressed co-cultures (mostly from latently-infected cells) had more Tat variants with impaired transactivation activity.

That work will be briefly reviewed, outlining how phylogenetic tools were extended to incorporate improved evolutionary models, how the molecular clock model was adapted to incorporate variable periods of latency, and how the approach was validated by correctly estimating the timing of two historically documented dates. The advantages, limitations, and assumptions of the approach will be summarized, with particular consideration of the implications of branch length uncertainty and recombination. We have recently undertaken new phylogenetic analysis of an extremely diverse set of human immunodeficiency virus envelope sequences from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC, formerly Zaire). This analysis both corroborates and extends the conclusions of our original study. Coalescent methods were used to infer the demographic history of the HIV-1 epidemic in the DRC, and the results suggest an increase in the exponential growth rate of the infected population through time.},

  Abstract                 = {Next-generation sequencing technologies can be used to analyse genetically heterogeneous samples at unprecedented detail. The high coverage achievable with these methods enables the detection of many low-frequency variants. However, sequencing errors complicate the analysis of mixed populations and result in inflated estimates of genetic diversity. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian approach to minimize the effect of errors on the detection of minority variants. We applied it to pyrosequencing data obtained from a 1.5-kb-fragment of the HIV-1 gag/pol gene in two control and two clinical samples. The effect of PCR amplification was analysed. Error correction resulted in a two- and five-fold decrease of the pyrosequencing base substitution rate, from 0.05\% to 0.03\% and from 0.25\% to 0.05\% in the non-PCR and PCR-amplified samples, respectively. We were able to detect viral clones as rare as 0.1\% with perfect sequence reconstruction. Probabilistic haplotype inference outperforms the counting-based calling method in both precision and recall. Genetic diversity observed within and between two clinical samples resulted in various patterns of phenotypic drug resistance and suggests a close epidemiological link. We conclude that pyrosequencing can be used to investigate genetically diverse samples with high accuracy if technical errors are properly treated.},

  Abstract                 = {Splicing of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, primary transcript is highly regulated. Maintaining the proper equilibrium among spliced, unspliced, and partially spliced isoforms is essential for the replication of the virus. Here we characterize a complex cis-acting element located in tat exon 2 that is required for the splicing regulation of the upstream intron. An exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) are both located within the regulatory element. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B proteins bind the ESS to repress splicing, whereas the SR protein SC35 binds the ESE to activate it. We show that the SC35 and the hnRNP A1 binding sites overlap within the juxtaposed ESE/ESS. We propose that hnRNP A1 binding to the ESS inhibits splicing of the upstream intron by directly masking the SC35 binding site.},

  Abstract                 = {Alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) is a common mechanism of regulating gene expression. SR proteins are a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors that are structurally related and evolutionarily conserved. Any member of the SR family can complement a splicing-deficient extract that lacks the entire family of SR proteins. Here it is demonstrated that particular SR proteins have distinct functions in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. In addition, SR proteins are differentially expressed in a variety of tissues. These results suggest a fundamental role for SR proteins in the regulation of alternative splicing.},

  Abstract                 = {Using optical microscopy, we have studied the phase behavior of mixtures of 12- to 22-bp-long nanoDNA oligomers. The mixtures are chosen such that only a fraction of the sample is composed of mutually complementary sequences, and hence the solutions are effectively mixtures of single-stranded and double-stranded (duplex) oligomers. When the concentrations are large enough, such mixtures phase-separate via the nucleation of duplex-rich liquid crystalline domains from an isotropic background rich in single strands. We find that the phase separation is approximately complete, thus corresponding to a spontaneous purification of duplexes from the single-strand oligos. We interpret this behavior as the combined result of the energy gain from the end-to-end stacking of duplexes and of depletion-type attractive interactions favoring the segregation of the more rigid duplexes from the flexible single strands. This form of spontaneous partitioning of complementary nDNA offers a route to purification of short duplex oligomers and, if in the presence of ligation, could provide a mode of positive feedback for the preferential synthesis of longer complementary oligomers, a mechanism of possible relevance in prebiotic environments.},

We report that immunization with these T cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) antigens causes up-regulation of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) RNAs in antigen-specific mouse B cells. These RNAs are detected via a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent RNA sensing pathway or reverse-transcribed and detected via the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway, triggering a second, sustained wave of signaling that promotes specific immunoglobulin M production. Deficiency of both MAVS and cGAS, or treatment of MAVS-deficient mice with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, dramatically inhibits TI-2 antibody responses. These findings suggest that ERV and two innate sensing pathways that detect them are integral components of the TI-2 B cell signaling apparatus.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate and rapid quantitation of Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels is a critical aspect in estimating the effect of antiviral therapy and establishing therapeutic schedule. Thus, for the first time, a rapid quantitative reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was designed to quantitate HIV-1 RNA. The results showed that the dynamic range was from 2.5×10(2) to 10(7) copies with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.991, and the limit of detection of RT-LAMP by Probit analysis at the 95\% detection level was 196 copies. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 0.67\% to 2.08\% at 10(7) copies and 7.25\% to 12.97\% at 250 copies. The CVs of inter-assay were 2.39\% and 13.93\% for the high and low copy numbers, respectively. No cross-reaction with Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), Human T lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was observed and a good agreement between the RT-LAMP method and the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test was achieved. This proposed RT-LAMP method could be useful for rapid diagnosis of high risk group and pharmacodynamic assessment of anti-HIV drug, especially in less-equipped laboratories of impoverished areas.},

Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of ∼8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

The criteria or parameters for evaluating the ³suitability² of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called ³Z-factor,² is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.},

  Abstract                 = {High mutation frequency during reverse transcription has a principal role in the genetic variation of primate lentiviral populations. It is the main driving force for the generation of drug resistance and the escape from immune surveillance. G to A hypermutation is one of the characteristics of primate lentiviruses, as well as other retroviruses, during replication in vivo and in cell culture. The molecular mechanisms of this process, however, remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that CEM15 (also known as apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G; APOBEC3G), an endogenous inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, is a cytidine deaminase and is able to induce G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA. This effect can be counteracted by the HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif). It seems that this viral DNA mutator is a viral defence mechanism in host cells that may induce either lethal hypermutation or instability of the incoming nascent viral reverse transcripts, which could account for the Vif-defective phenotype. Importantly, the accumulation of CEM15-mediated non-lethal hypermutation in the replicating viral genome could potently contribute to the genetic variation of primate lentiviral populations.},

In this study, our goal was to investigate the mechanisms by which miR-34a influenced Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through the SIRT1/NFκB pathway. We showed that Tat induced up-regulation of miR-34a expression in TZM-bl cells. MiR-34a significantly inhibited SIRT1 expression. Overexpression of miR-34a increased Tat-induced LTR transactivation. Forced expression of miR-34a decreased SIRT1 protein expression and consequently diminished Tat-induced acetylation of p65, while treatment with a miR-34a inhibitor had the opposite effect. These results suggest that regulating SIRT1 by down-regulation of miR-34a levels may be a therapeutic strategy against HIV-1 replication.},

The Tat protein is fundamental to viral gene expression. In this study, our goal was to investigate the regulation of a specific miRNA (known as miR-217) in multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator (MAGI) cells and explore the mechanisms by which miR-217 influenced Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through down-regulation of SIRT1 expression. We showed that miR-217 was up-regulated when Tat was expressed in multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator cells. Forced expression of "miR-217 mimics" increased Tat-induced LTR transactivation. In addition, miR-217 significantly inhibited SIRT1 protein expression by acting on the 3'-UTR of the SIRT1 mRNA. In turn, the decrease in SIRT1 protein abundance provoked by miR-217 affected two important types of downstream signaling molecules that were regulated by Tat. Lower expression of SIRT1 caused by miR-217 enhanced Tat-induced phosphorylation of IKK and p65-NFkB and also exacerbated the loss of AMPK phosphorylation triggered by Tat. Our results uncover previously unknown links between Tat and a specific host cell miRNA that targets SIRT1. We also demonstrate that this regulatory mechanism impinges on p65-NFkB and AMPK signaling: two important host cell pathways that influence HIV-1 pathogenesis. Our results also suggest that strategies to augment SIRT1 protein expression by down-regulation of miR-217 may have therapeutic benefits to prevent HIV-1 replication.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:Alternative splicing increases protein diversity by generating multiple transcript isoforms from a single gene through different combinations of exons or through different selections of splice sites. It has been reported that RNA secondary structures are involved in alternative splicing. Here we perform a genomic study of RNA secondary structures around splice sites in humans (Homo sapiens), mice (Mus musculus), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) to further investigate this phenomenon.We observe that GC content around splice sites is closely associated with the splice site usage in multiple species. RNA secondary structure is the possible explanation, because the structural stability difference among alternative splice sites, constitutive splice sites, and skipped splice sites can be explained by the GC content difference. Alternative splice sites tend to be GC-enriched and exhibit more stable RNA secondary structures in all of the considered species. In humans and mice, splice sites of first exons and long exons tend to be GC-enriched and hence form more stable structures, indicating the special role of RNA secondary structures in promoter proximal splicing events and the splicing of long exons. In addition, GC-enriched exon-intron junctions tend to be overrepresented in tissue-specific alternative splice sites, indicating the functional consequence of the GC effect. Compared with regions far from splice sites and decoy splice sites, real splice sites are GC-enriched. We also found that the GC-content effect is much stronger than the nucleotide-order effect to form stable secondary structures.All of these results indicate that GC content is related to splice site usage and it may mediate the splicing process through RNA secondary structures.},

This classification could serve as a standard for future studies so that direct comparisons of results can be made. A database for eight categories (related to human genes in which coding regions are split by introns) was built from GenBank release 87.0 and analyzed by a number of methods to characterize statistical features of these sequences that may serve as controls or regulatory signals for gene expression. The statistical information compiled includes profiles of signals for transcription, splicing and translation, various compositional statistics and size distributions. Further analyses reveal novel correlations and constraints among different splicing features across an internal exon that are consistent with the Exon Definition model. This information is fundamental for a quantitative view of human gene organization, and should be invaluable for individual scientists to design human molecular genetics experiments.},

We found that 40\% of new human exons are alternatively spliced, and most of these are cassette exons (exons that are either included or skipped in their entirety) with low inclusion rates. This proportion decreases steadily as older and older exons are examined, even as splicing efficiency increases. Remarkably, the great majority of new cassette exons are composed of highly repeated sequences, especially Alu. Many new cassette exons are 5' untranslated exons; the proportion that code for protein increases steadily with age. New protein-coding exons evolve at a high rate, as evidenced by the initially high substitution rates (K(s) and K(a)), as well as the SNP density compared with older exons. This dynamic picture suggests that de novo recruitment rather than shuffling is the major route by which exons are added to genes, and that species-specific repeats could play a significant role in recent evolution.},

The surprising ability of SIV and HIV to replicate in resting cells in vivo, in contrast to propagation of infection in vitro, suggested a model in which during the early stages of infection these viruses exploit the greater availability of resting cells to maintain unbroken chains of transmission from an infected resting cell to another resting cell nearby. Because immune activation in response to infection provides more activated CD4(+) T cells, these viruses take advantage of the greater efficiency of virus production and spread in activated cells for propagation and dissemination of infection. In this article, we report the results of experimental tests of this model, including visualization at the light microscopic level and direct analysis of virus production by cells in tissues. Analysis of tissues of rhesus macaques inoculated intravaginally or i.v. with SIV supports the proposed roles of target cell availability, susceptibility, and virus production by infected resting and activated CD4(+) T cells in mucosal transmission and early infection, and points to a potential role for topical anti-inflammatory agents in moderating the initial propagation of infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Retroviral capsid proteins are conserved structurally but assemble into different morphologies. The mature human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid is best described by a 'fullerene cone' model, in which hexamers of the capsid protein are linked to form a hexagonal surface lattice that is closed by incorporating 12 capsid-protein pentamers. HIV-1 capsid protein contains an amino-terminal domain (NTD) comprising seven α-helices and a β-hairpin, a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) comprising four α-helices, and a flexible linker with a 310-helix connecting the two structural domains. Structures of the capsid-protein assembly units have been determined by X-ray crystallography; however, structural information regarding the assembled capsid and the contacts between the assembly units is incomplete. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a tubular HIV-1 capsid-protein assembly at 8 Å resolution and the three-dimensional structure of a native HIV-1 core by cryo-electron tomography. The structure of the tubular assembly shows, at the three-fold interface, a three-helix bundle with critical hydrophobic interactions. Mutagenesis studies confirm that hydrophobic residues in the centre of the three-helix bundle are crucial for capsid assembly and stability, and for viral infectivity. The cryo-electron-microscopy structures enable modelling by large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, resulting in all-atom models for the hexamer-of-hexamer and pentamer-of-hexamer elements as well as for the entire capsid. Incorporation of pentamers results in closer trimer contacts and induces acute surface curvature. The complete atomic HIV-1 capsid model provides a platform for further studies of capsid function and for targeted pharmacological intervention.},

In marked contrast, its human counterpart, hp32, not only blocks this splicing but promotes the accumulation of viral genomic transcripts and structural proteins, resulting in the assembly and release of infectious virions. A single substitution in hp32 of Gly 35 to Asp 35, which is found in mp32, abrogates this activity. Thus, hp32 overcomes an important post-transcriptional block to HIV replication in murine cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 depends on the host cell machinery to support its replication. To discover cellular factors associated with HIV-1 replication, we conducted a genome-scale siRNA screen, revealing more than 311 host factors, including 267 that were not previously linked to HIV. Surprisingly, there was little overlap between these genes and the HIV dependency factors described recently. However, an analysis of the genes identified in both screens revealed overlaps in several of the associated pathways or protein complexes, including the SP1/mediator complex and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. cDNAs for a subset of the identified genes were used to rescue HIV replication following knockdown of the cellular mRNA providing strong evidence that the following six genes are previously uncharacterized host factors for HIV: AKT1, PRKAA1, CD97, NEIL3, BMP2K, and SERPINB6. This study highlights both the power and shortcomings of large scale loss-of-function screens in discovering host-pathogen interactions.},

We applied cryoelectron microscopy tomography to define ultrastructural details of spikes. Virions of wild-type human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and a mutant simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) had approximately 14 and approximately 73 spikes per particle, respectively, with some clustering of HIV-1 spikes. Three-dimensional averaging showed that the surface glycoprotein (gp120) 'head' of each subunit of the trimeric SIV spike contains a primary mass, with two secondary lobes. The transmembrane glycoprotein 'stalk' of each trimer is composed of three independent legs that project obliquely from the trimer head, tripod-like. Reconciling available atomic structures with the three-dimensional whole spike density map yields insights into the orientation of Env spike structural elements and possible structural bases of their functions.},

If available, HIV-1 sequences pre-dating the recognition of AIDS could be crucial in defining the time of origin and the subsequent evolution of these viruses in humans. The oldest known case of HIV-1 infection was reported to be that of a sailor from Manchester who died of an AIDS-like illness in 1959; however, the authenticity of this case has not been confirmed. Genetic analysis of sequences from clinical materials obtained from 1971 to 1976 from members of a Norwegian family infected earlier than 1971 showed that they carried viruses of the HIV-1 outlier group, a variant form that is mainly restricted to West Africa. Here we report the amplification and characterization of viral sequences from a 1959 African plasma sample that was previously found to be HIV-1 seropositive. Multiple phylogenetic analyses not only authenticate this case as the oldest known HIV-1 infection, but also place its viral sequence near the ancestral node of subtypes B and D in the major group, indicating that these HIV-1 subtypes, and perhaps all major-group viruses, may have evolved from a single introduction into the African population not long before 1959.},

Similarly, HIV-1 may replicate in macrophages in vivo, whereas it is unclear whether blood monocytes are permissive to productive infection with HIV-1. We investigated HIV-1 replication in CD14(+) monocytes and resting and activated CD4(+) T cells by measuring the levels of cell-associated viral DNA and mRNA and the genetic evolution of HIV-1 in seven acutely infected patients whose plasma viremia had been <100 copies/ml for 803 to 1,544 days during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV-1 DNA was detected in CD14(+) monocytes as well as in activated and resting CD4(+) T cells throughout the course of study. While significant variation in the decay slopes of HIV-1 DNA was seen among individual patients, viral decay in CD14(+) monocytes was on average slower than that in activated and resting CD4(+) T cells. Measurements of HIV-1 sequence evolution and the concentrations of unspliced and multiply spliced mRNA provided evidence of ongoing HIV-1 replication, more pronounced in CD14(+) monocytes than in resting CD4(+) T cells. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences indicated that after prolonged HAART, viral populations related or identical to those found only in CD14(+) monocytes were seen in plasma from three of the seven patients. In the other four patients, HIV-1 sequences in plasma and the three cell populations were identical. CD14(+) monocytes appear to be one of the potential in vivo sources of HIV-1 in patients receiving HAART.},

Overexpression of ZAP rendered cells resistant to HIV-1 infection in a ZAP expression level-dependent manner, whereas depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced HIV-1 infection. Both human and rat ZAP inhibited the propagation of replication-competent HIV-1. ZAP specifically targeted the multiply spliced but not unspliced or singly spliced HIV-1 mRNAs for degradation. We provide evidence indicating that ZAP selectively recruits cellular poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) to shorten the poly(A) tail of target viral mRNA and recruits the RNA exosome to degrade the RNA body from the 3' end. In addition, ZAP recruits cellular decapping complex through its cofactor RNA helicase p72 to initiate degradation of the target viral mRNA from the 5' end. Depletion of each of these mRNA degradation enzymes reduced ZAP's activity. Our results indicate that ZAP inhibits HIV-1 by recruiting both the 5' and 3' mRNA degradation machinery to specifically promote the degradation of multiply spliced HIV-1 mRNAs.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously, we reported that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombines approximately two to three times per genome per replication cycle, an extremely high rate of recombination given the relatively small genome size of HIV-1. However, a recombination hot spot involving sequence of nonretroviral origin was identified in the vector system utilized, raising the possibility that this hot spot skewed the rate of recombination, and the rate of recombination observed was an overestimation. To address this issue, an HIV-1-derived vector system was used to examine the rate of recombination between autologous HIV-1 sequences after restricting replication to a single cycle in the absence of this hot spot. Viral DNA and RNA were analyzed by a combination of the heteroduplex tracking assay, restriction enzyme analysis, DNA sequencing, and reverse transcription-PCR. The results indicate that HIV-1 undergoes recombination at a minimum rate of 2.8 crossovers per genome per cycle. Again, this is a very high rate given the small size of the HIV-1 genome. The results also suggested that there might be local hot spots of recombination at different locations throughout the genome since 13 of the 33 strand transfers identified by DNA sequencing shared the same site of recombination with one or two other clones. Furthermore, identification of crossover segments also allowed examination of mutations at the point of recombination, since it has been predicted from some studies of cell-free systems that mutations may occur with a frequency of 30 to 50\% at crossover junctions. However, DNA sequence analysis of crossover junctions indicated that homologous recombination during viral replication was not particularly mutagenic, indicating that there are other factors or conditions not yet reproduced in cell-free systems which contribute to fidelity during retroviral recombination.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new computer method for folding an RNA molecule that finds a conformation of minimum free energy using published values of stacking and destabilizing energies. It is based on a dynamic programming algorithm from applied mathematics, and is much more efficient, faster, and can fold larger molecules than procedures which have appeared up to now in the biological literature. Its power is demonstrated in the folding of a 459 nucleotide immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy chain messenger RNA fragment. We go beyond the basic method to show how to incorporate additional information into the algorithm. This includes data on chemical reactivity and enzyme susceptibility. We illustrate this with the folding of two large fragments from the 16S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli.},
