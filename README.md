# phdThesis

LaTeX source for my PhD thesis. The LaTeX was based on the [template provided by the provost](http://www.upenn.edu/provost/images/uploads/LaTeX%20Dissertation%20Template%20for%20Wharton.tex) which I mostly moved into [a style file](penn_thesis_style.sty) (although not as cleanly as I would have liked due to time restrictions). It sucessfully passed the University of Pennsylvania thesis formatting check so I guess it should be a valid UPenn format although, of course, no guarantees.

The final output file is [here](sherrill-Mix_thesis.pdf).
